## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Webhook Handler Architecture
```typescript
// Handles all three critical Stripe events:
- payment_intent.succeeded → Creates 'paid' correlation
- payment_intent.payment_failed → Creates 'failed' correlation  
- checkout.session.completed → Creates session correlation
```

### Correlation Data Structure
```sql
-- Rich correlation tracking with full context
payment_outcome_correlations (
  stripe_payment_intent_id,
  client_id,
  outcome_type,
  payment_metadata,      -- Stripe event data + custom fields
  journey_context,       -- Page sequence, timing, attribution
  conversion_duration,   -- Time from journey start to payment
  correlation_timestamp
)
```

### Learning Integration Points
- **Content Version Tracking**: Links payments to specific content versions for A/B testing
- **Hypothesis Validation**: Correlates client hypotheses with payment success rates
- **Journey Analytics**: Tracks page sequences leading to successful conversions
- **Timing Intelligence**: Measures optimal timing from engagement to payment
