## ‚ö° Quick Validation (15 minutes)

### Core System Test

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Verify: Server starts without errors
   # Verify: No Stripe configuration warnings (if configured)
   ```

2. **Dashboard Access Test**
   ```bash
   # Open browser to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   # Expected: Dashboard loads with client management interface
   # Expected: Statistics cards display (Total, Activated, Pending, etc.)
   # Expected: At least one test client visible (TechCorp Solutions)
   ```

3. **Client Creation Test**
   - Click "Create Client" button
   - Fill required fields including "Journey Hypothesis"
   - Submit form
   - **Expected**: New client appears in dashboard
   - **Expected**: Client has G[4-digit] token generated

4. **Journey Navigation Test**
   ```bash
   # Use test token: http://localhost:3000/journey/G1001
   # Expected: 4-page journey navigation works
   # Expected: All pages (activation ‚Üí agreement ‚Üí confirmation ‚Üí processing) load
   ```

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

### Epic 1 Features - Journey Infrastructure

**Test 1.1: Client Creation with Hypothesis**
```bash
Scenario: Admin creates new client
Given: Admin accesses dashboard
When: Admin clicks "Create Client"
And: Admin fills all required fields including hypothesis
Then: Client is created with unique G[4-digit] token
And: 4 journey pages are automatically generated
And: Client appears in dashboard list
```

**Test 1.2: Multi-Page Journey Navigation**
```bash
Scenario: Client accesses their journey
Given: Client has token G1001
When: Client visits /journey/G1001
Then: Journey overview loads with progress indicators
When: Client navigates between pages
Then: Each page (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) loads correctly
And: Navigation maintains context and progress
```

**Test 1.3: Admin Content Management**
```bash
Scenario: Admin edits journey content
Given: Admin accesses /dashboard/journey/1
When: Admin clicks on any page tab
And: Admin edits content and adds page hypothesis
Then: Content saves with hypothesis metadata
And: Content history shows previous versions
And: Changes reflect on client-facing pages
```

**Test 1.4: Journey Progress Tracking**
```bash
Scenario: Journey progress visualization
Given: Client with active journey
When: Admin views client in dashboard
Then: Journey progress shows current step
And: Progress percentage displays correctly
And: Status badges reflect current page states
```

### Epic 2 Features - Learning Capture System

**Test 2.1: Outcome Tracking UI**
```bash
Scenario: Admin marks journey outcome
Given: Client exists in dashboard
When: Admin clicks client dropdown menu
Then: Outcome options are visible (Mark Paid, Mark Responded, Mark Ghosted)
When: Admin selects "Mark Paid"
Then: Client outcome updates to "paid"
And: Outcome timestamp is recorded
And: Dashboard statistics update (+1 Paid Clients)
```

**Test 2.2: Bulk Outcome Operations**
```bash
Scenario: Admin updates multiple client outcomes
Given: Multiple clients exist
When: Admin selects multiple clients (if implemented)
And: Admin chooses bulk outcome action
Then: All selected clients update simultaneously
And: Statistics reflect bulk changes
```

**Test 2.3: Payment Webhook Processing**
```bash
Scenario: Stripe webhook updates client outcome
Given: Webhook endpoint is configured
When: Test payment webhook is sent:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "stripe-signature: test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "payment_intent.succeeded",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "metadata": {
          "client_id": "1",
          "client_token": "G1001"
        },
        "amount": 50000
      }
    }
  }'

Then: Client automatically marked as "paid"
And: Payment amount recorded ($500.00)
And: Outcome notes include payment details
```

## üîç Integration Testing

### Stripe Integration Tests

```

**Test: Environment Variable Handling**
```bash
# Test graceful degradation
# Remove STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from environment

# Expected: Clear warnings about missing configuration
```

**Test: Payment Metadata Correlation**
```bash
# Test payment utility functions
node -e "
const { createPaymentIntentWithMetadata } = require('./lib/stripe-utils');
// Should handle missing Stripe configuration gracefully
"
```

### Database Integration Tests

**Test: Mock Data Fallback**
```bash
# Test without database configuration
# Remove SUPABASE_URL from environment
# Restart server
# Expected: System uses mock data seamlessly
# Expected: All functionality works
```

**Test: Database Operations** (if Supabase configured)
```bash
