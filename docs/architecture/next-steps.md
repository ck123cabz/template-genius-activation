# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff
Create implementation stories for BMAD orchestration with this architectural guidance:

**Reference this architecture document** for comprehensive technical decisions and integration patterns validated through interactive design process. **Key integration requirements** include test/live client segmentation, template-based content management, and clean data layer separation. **Existing system constraints** based on Next.js 15 App Router, 40+ Shadcn/ui components, and Supabase hybrid architecture.

**First story to implement:** "Enhance ClientList component with client type selection" - establishes foundation for segmentation with clear integration checkpoints and validation against existing UI patterns. **Emphasis on maintaining existing system integrity** throughout implementation by leveraging established component patterns and data access methods.

## Developer Handoff
Begin implementation using enhanced server actions and strategic component enhancement:

**Reference this architecture and existing coding standards** analyzed from Next.js 15 App Router patterns, TypeScript strict mode, and Shadcn/ui component library. **Integration requirements** focus on preserving existing development workflow while enabling template-based content management and payment processing.

**Key technical decisions** include server actions over REST APIs, template-based content storage for efficiency, and test/live client segmentation for business validation. **Existing system compatibility requirements** with specific verification steps ensure enhanced components integrate seamlessly with current dashboard and content management patterns.

**Clear sequencing of implementation** prioritizes client type selection, then template management, then payment integration to minimize risk to existing functionality while enabling progressive business validation.
