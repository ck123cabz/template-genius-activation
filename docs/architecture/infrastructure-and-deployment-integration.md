# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** Vercel hosting with automatic deployments from GitHub, Docker containerization support  
**Infrastructure Tools:** GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for containerized development, pnpm for package management  
**Environments:** Development (local), Preview (Vercel branch deployments), Production (main branch)

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach:** Gradual rollout using existing Vercel infrastructure with feature flags  
**Infrastructure Changes:** New environment variables for Stripe integration, database migration execution  
**Pipeline Integration:** Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow to include database migrations and environment validation

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method:** Database migration rollback scripts with feature flag disabling for instant rollback  
**Risk Mitigation:** Feature flags allow disabling enhancements without code deployment, database backups before major migrations  
**Monitoring:** Enhanced logging for payment processing, client creation, and template operations with Vercel Analytics
