# Security Integration

## Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** Currently public access (acknowledged limitation for validation phase)  
**Authorization:** No user-based authorization (single admin interface)  
**Data Protection:** Environment variables for sensitive configuration, HTTPS enforced by Vercel  
**Security Tools:** TypeScript strict mode for type safety, Next.js built-in security features

## Enhancement Security Requirements
**New Security Measures:** Stripe webhook signature verification, input validation with Zod schemas, rate limiting for payment operations  
**Integration Points:** Server actions with comprehensive validation, secure environment variable management for Stripe keys  
**Compliance Requirements:** PCI compliance through Stripe Checkout (no card data stored), basic data protection for client information

## Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** Basic input validation through TypeScript strict mode  
**New Security Test Requirements:** Stripe webhook signature validation testing, payment flow security testing, client data protection verification  
**Penetration Testing:** Manual testing of payment flows, webhook endpoint security, client data access patterns
