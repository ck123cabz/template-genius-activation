# Issues identified during comprehensive review
top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "No dedicated test file exists for Story 3.2 payment dashboard functionality"
    suggested_action: "Create comprehensive test suite at tests/story-3-2-payment-dashboard.spec.ts covering all 5 acceptance criteria"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Revenue analytics calculations performed client-side without caching or optimization"
    suggested_action: "Move complex analytics to server actions with caching for improved dashboard performance"
  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing performance validation tests for IV3 requirement (dashboard loading under 2 seconds)"
    suggested_action: "Add Playwright performance tests to validate dashboard loading time requirements"
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Payment session IDs partially exposed in UI components for debugging"
    suggested_action: "Implement proper masking/truncation of sensitive payment identifiers in production"
