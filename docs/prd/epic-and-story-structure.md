# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision:** Single comprehensive epic approach with rationale based on brownfield architecture analysis.

**Rationale:**
- **Existing Codebase Integration:** The Template Genius platform already has established patterns and 40+ Shadcn components that should be enhanced rather than replaced
- **Minimal Risk Strategy:** Single epic allows incremental integration while maintaining existing functionality throughout development
- **BMAD Orchestration Efficiency:** Single epic allows BMAD agents to maintain context and leverage existing patterns more effectively than fragmented approach  
- **Learning System Integration:** Revenue intelligence features are interconnected (hypothesis → content → outcome → pattern) and benefit from coordinated implementation
- **Brownfield Best Practice:** For existing systems, comprehensive enhancement in coordinated phases reduces integration risk compared to multiple disconnected epics

**Integration Requirements:**
- All new features must integrate with existing Next.js 15 App Router patterns without breaking current flows
- Preserve mock data fallback system during Supabase transition with graceful degradation
- Maintain existing G[4-digit] token system for client access without URL changes
- Reuse all 40+ existing Shadcn/ui components without modification or replacement
- Follow established server action patterns for all data operations
