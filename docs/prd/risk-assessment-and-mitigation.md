# Risk Assessment and Mitigation

## Critical Risks

**Risk 1: Learning Capture Overhead**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (defeats purpose if too cumbersome)
- **Mitigation:** Keep hypothesis fields short, quick dropdown outcomes
- **Monitoring:** Track time-to-capture metrics

**Risk 2: Pattern Recognition Accuracy**
- **Probability:** Low (simple patterns initially)
- **Impact:** Medium (wrong recommendations)
- **Mitigation:** Require 3+ examples before pattern, manual review initially
- **Monitoring:** Track pattern success rate

**Risk 3: BMAD Implementation Variance**
- **Probability:** Low (architecture well-defined)
- **Impact:** Medium (rework required)
- **Mitigation:** Clear architecture document, Serena memory guidance
- **Monitoring:** Daily implementation review
