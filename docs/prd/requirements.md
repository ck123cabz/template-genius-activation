# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1:** System shall manage content for all 4 client pages (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) with isolated versions preventing cross-contamination

**FR2:** System shall require hypothesis capture before content changes with "Why will this work?" reasoning stored with each version

**FR3:** System shall track journey outcomes (paid/ghosted/responded) with detailed notes explaining what happened

**FR4:** System shall integrate with Stripe for $500 activation fee collection with payment status visible in admin dashboard

**FR5:** System shall link payments to specific content versions active at payment time for conversion correlation

**FR6:** System shall identify successful content patterns after 3+ similar outcomes and highlight failure patterns to avoid

**FR7:** Admin shall be able to edit any page for any specific client with changes isolated to that client only

**FR8:** System shall provide recommendations for new clients based on past successful patterns

**FR9:** System shall track time-to-payment metrics by content variation for performance analysis

**FR10:** Learning data shall persist via Serena memory system across development sessions

**FR11:** Side-by-side comparison of successful vs failed journeys for advanced analytics

**FR12:** A/B test creation for hypothesis validation and bulk operations support

## Non Functional

**NFR1:** Client pages shall load in <3 seconds to maintain conversion potential

**NFR2:** Admin content saves shall complete in <2 seconds for efficient workflow

**NFR3:** Pattern recognition shall update within 5 seconds of outcome recording

**NFR4:** System shall support 100+ client journeys in Supabase free tier

**NFR5:** System shall handle 5+ concurrent admin operations without performance degradation

**NFR6:** System shall store 500+ learning iterations with full hypothesis/outcome history

**NFR7:** Learning capture shall complete in <30 seconds per client interaction

**NFR8:** Pattern identification shall work without technical knowledge required

**NFR9:** All interfaces shall be mobile-responsive using existing Tailwind breakpoints

**NFR10:** System shall maintain existing performance characteristics without exceeding current memory usage by more than 20%

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1: Existing API Compatibility**
- All existing admin dashboard endpoints must continue functioning unchanged
- Client activation flow URLs must remain unchanged (G[4-digit] tokens) 
- Mock data fallback must be preserved during Supabase transition
- Server actions pattern must be maintained for all data operations

**CR2: Database Schema Compatibility**  
- New journey tables must extend existing client schema without breaking changes
- Support both mock and database modes simultaneously with graceful fallback
- All migrations must be reversible with rollback capability
- Foreign key relationships must respect existing client structure

**CR3: UI/UX Consistency**
- All 40+ existing Shadcn components must be reused without modification
- New features must follow established Tailwind patterns and spacing
- Dark mode support must be maintained across all new interfaces
- Existing navigation structure and user flows must be preserved

**CR4: Integration Compatibility**
- Stripe integration must not affect existing payment processing flows
- Supabase connection must gracefully degrade to mock data on failure
- All new server actions must follow existing Next.js 15 patterns and error handling
- Learning system must integrate with existing BMAD + Serena architecture
