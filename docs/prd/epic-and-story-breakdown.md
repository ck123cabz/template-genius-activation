## Brownfield Enhancement Epic

### Epic 8: Real-Time Journey Progress Tracking - Brownfield Enhancement

**Epic Goal:** Enable admins to track client progress through their journey in real-time, providing instant visibility into where clients are in the activation flow and how long they spend on each page, improving response timing and conversion optimization.

#### Epic Analysis

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Admin dashboard shows static client journey status
- Technology stack: Next.js 15 with Supabase, existing Shadcn/ui components
- Integration points: Client dashboard UI, journey tracking database, client activation pages

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Real-time progress indicators and live journey tracking
- How it integrates: WebSocket connection or polling to update dashboard without refresh
- Success criteria: Sub-5 second updates on client page transitions, visual progress indicators

#### Stories

1. **Story 1:** Real-Time Journey Progress API - Create server actions that expose live journey status with page transitions and time tracking
2. **Story 2:** Live Dashboard Updates - Implement real-time updates in admin dashboard using WebSocket or polling to show current client page and duration
3. **Story 3:** Visual Progress Indicators - Add progress bar and status indicators to existing dashboard UI showing journey completion percentage

#### Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - Only adding new server actions, not modifying existing ones
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - Adding tracking fields, not modifying existing structure  
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - Using established Shadcn/ui components and dashboard patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - Real-time updates use efficient polling/WebSocket without heavy queries

#### Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Real-time updates could impact dashboard performance with multiple concurrent users
- **Mitigation:** Implement efficient polling strategy (5-second intervals) with client-side caching and debouncing
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable real-time updates, falling back to existing manual refresh behavior

#### Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing - Dashboard still works without real-time features
- [x] Integration points working correctly - Journey tracking integrates seamlessly with existing client flows
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately - Serena memory updated with real-time patterns
- [x] No regression in existing features - Existing client creation and editing workflows unaffected

#### Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + Supabase
- Integration points: Admin dashboard UI components, client_journeys database table, existing Shadcn/ui component library
- Existing patterns to follow: Server actions for data operations, Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui for styling, polling patterns for live data
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break existing client creation/editing workflows, performance impact must be negligible
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering real-time journey progress visibility for immediate admin response and conversion optimization."
