# Epic 2: Learning Capture System Implementation

**Epic Goal:** Implement systematic learning capture that tracks hypotheses before content changes and outcomes after client interactions, enabling data-driven conversion optimization while maintaining all existing admin workflows.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing content editing interfaces without breaking current functionality
- Preserve existing admin workflow patterns while adding learning requirements
- Integrate with existing Stripe webhook system for automatic outcome tracking

## Story 2.1: Hypothesis Capture for Content Changes

As an admin,
I want to capture why I'm making each content change with a hypothesis field,
so that I can learn from outcomes and understand what drives conversion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Page editor includes "Page Hypothesis" field explaining why specific content changes will work
2. Content saving requires hypothesis entry before changes are persisted
3. Hypothesis entry supports quick dropdown options for common theories plus custom entry
4. Page-level hypothesis links to overall journey hypothesis for strategic alignment
5. Hypothesis data stores with content version for outcome correlation

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing content editing interfaces continue to function for users who skip hypothesis entry
- IV2: Current admin workflow preserved while encouraging hypothesis capture through UX design
- IV3: Content saving performance remains under 2 seconds with hypothesis capture

## Story 2.2: Journey Outcome Tracking

As an admin,
I want to mark journey outcomes (paid/ghosted/responded) with detailed notes,
so that I can identify patterns and understand what makes clients convert.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Outcome marking available from dashboard (paid/ghosted/pending/responded)
2. Outcome notes field for detailed learning capture explaining what happened
3. Outcome timestamp tracking for conversion analysis
4. Bulk outcome marking for efficiency with multiple clients
5. Outcome history visible in client journey view

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Dashboard performance remains unchanged with outcome tracking addition
- IV2: Existing client status indicators continue to work alongside outcome markers
- IV3: Current dashboard filtering and sorting preserved with new outcome data

## Story 2.3: Automatic Payment-Outcome Correlation

As the system,
I want to automatically link Stripe payments to journey outcomes,
so that learning data is accurate and admins don't need manual correlation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Stripe webhook updates journey outcome automatically on payment success
2. Payment metadata includes journey ID and content version for correlation
3. Failed payments trigger appropriate outcome status updates
4. Payment timing data captured for time-to-conversion analysis
5. Manual outcome override available for edge cases

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing Stripe webhook processing continues to work without modification
- IV2: Current payment flow performance maintained with metadata addition
- IV3: Payment failure handling preserved while adding outcome tracking
