# Out of Scope

## Explicitly Not in Phase I
- User authentication (admin access only)
- Email automation (manual sending)
- Complex analytics (basic patterns only)
- Template library (Phase III)
- Multi-admin support (single operator)

## Deferred to Phase II
- A/B testing framework
- Cohort analysis
- Advanced visualizations
- Batch operations
- Export functionality

## Future Considerations
- AI-powered content generation
- Predictive analytics
- Multi-language support
- White-label capability
- API for external integrations
