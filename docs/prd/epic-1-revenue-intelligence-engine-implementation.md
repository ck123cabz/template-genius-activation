# Epic 1: Revenue Intelligence Engine Implementation

**Epic Goal:** Transform the existing Template Genius platform into a Revenue Intelligence Engine that captures learning from every client interaction across the complete 4-page journey (activation → agreement → confirmation → processing), enabling systematic conversion optimization through hypothesis tracking, outcome recording, and pattern recognition while preserving all existing functionality.

**Integration Requirements:** 
- Enhance existing components rather than replace them
- Maintain backward compatibility with current admin dashboard and client flows
- Integrate learning capture seamlessly into existing workflows
- Preserve mock data system during database transition

## Story 1.1: Client Creation with Journey Hypothesis Tracking

As an admin,
I want to create clients with an overall journey hypothesis and automatic 4-page setup,
so that I can systematically track my conversion strategy from the moment I engage each prospect.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Client creation form includes required "Overall Journey Hypothesis" field with clear prompting
2. System automatically creates all 4 journey pages (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) when client is created
3. Each page receives default content structure while maintaining existing G[4-digit] token system  
4. Client dashboard shows journey status indicators alongside existing client information
5. Hypothesis field supports rich text entry up to 500 characters for detailed strategy capture

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client creation flow continues to work without the hypothesis field for backward compatibility
- IV2: Mock data system creates journey structure alongside client data without database dependency
- IV3: Current client listing and management functionality remains unchanged after enhancement

## Story 1.2: Multi-Page Journey Infrastructure

As an admin,
I want to navigate between and edit all 4 pages of a client's journey with content isolation,
so that I can control the complete client experience while ensuring changes don't affect other clients.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Journey editor provides tabbed navigation between activation, agreement, confirmation, and processing pages
2. Content changes save independently for each page with version tracking
3. Each client's journey content is completely isolated from all other clients
4. Page editor uses existing rich text editing capabilities with enhanced structure
5. Navigation preserves unsaved changes with appropriate warning dialogs

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing individual page editing functionality continues to work through current URLs
- IV2: Client token access (G[4-digit]) provides seamless experience across all 4 pages
- IV3: Current page rendering and styling maintained with new navigation overlay

## Story 1.3: Admin Journey Page Navigation & Editing

As an admin,
I want to edit individual journey pages with hypothesis capture for each content change,
so that I can learn what specific content modifications drive conversion outcomes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each page editor includes "Page Hypothesis" field explaining why specific content changes will work
2. Content saving requires hypothesis entry before changes are persisted  
3. Page editor shows content history with associated hypotheses for learning reference
4. Hypothesis entry supports quick dropdown options for common theories plus custom entry
5. Page-level hypothesis links to overall journey hypothesis for strategic alignment

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing content editing interfaces function normally for users who skip hypothesis entry
- IV2: Current admin workflow preserved while encouraging hypothesis capture through UX design
- IV3: Page content rendering maintains existing performance and styling characteristics

## Story 1.4: Client Journey Access & Experience

As a client,
I want to access my personalized journey through my unique token with consistent, professional experience across all pages,
so that I feel confident progressing through the activation process to payment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Client token (G[4-digit]) provides access to complete 4-page journey experience
2. Navigation between pages maintains context and personalization throughout journey
3. Each page reflects admin's hypothesis-driven content specific to that client  
4. Journey flow guides client naturally from activation through confirmation
5. Professional, consistent styling maintained across all pages using existing design system

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client access URLs and token system function without modification
- IV2: Current page loading performance maintained across extended journey
- IV3: Mobile responsiveness preserved across all journey pages using existing Tailwind patterns
