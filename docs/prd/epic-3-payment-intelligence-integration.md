# Epic 3: Payment Intelligence Integration

**Epic Goal:** Implement comprehensive Stripe integration for $500 activation fee collection with intelligent tracking that correlates payments to specific journey content versions for conversion analysis.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing payment infrastructure without affecting current flows
- Maintain existing G[4-digit] token system for client access
- Preserve current page loading performance during payment integration

## Story 3.1: Stripe Checkout Integration

As an admin,
I want Stripe Checkout integration for the $500 activation fee,
so that clients can pay securely while I track which content drove the conversion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Stripe Checkout session creation with journey metadata embedded
2. Payment flow includes client journey context for correlation
3. Checkout process maintains professional, consistent branding
4. Payment success redirects to confirmation page with next steps
5. Payment failure handling with clear retry options

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing payment processing infrastructure continues to work unchanged
- IV2: Current security and PCI compliance maintained with new integration
- IV3: Page loading performance stays under 3 seconds for payment pages

## Story 3.2: Payment Status Dashboard Integration

As an admin,
I want to see payment status in the dashboard integrated with journey progress,
so that I know who has paid and can track conversion patterns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Payment status visible in dashboard (pending/succeeded/failed/refunded)
2. Journey progress indicators show payment step completion
3. Payment amount and timing visible in client detail view
4. Failed payment alerts with retry action buttons
5. Revenue tracking dashboard with weekly/monthly totals

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing dashboard layout and performance maintained with payment integration
- IV2: Current client listing functionality preserved with new payment columns
- IV3: Dashboard loading time remains under 2 seconds with payment data

## Story 3.3: Content-Payment Correlation Tracking

As the system,
I want to freeze journey content at payment time and track time-to-payment metrics,
so that successful content can be identified and replicated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Journey content snapshot created at payment initiation
2. Time-to-payment tracking from content change to payment completion
3. Content correlation data available for pattern analysis
4. A/B testing capability for different content variations
5. Historical payment correlation data for trend analysis

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Content editing performance maintained with snapshot functionality
- IV2: Existing content versioning system preserved while adding payment correlation
- IV3: Database performance remains optimal with correlation tracking tables
