# Epic 5: Advanced Journey Analytics

**Epic Goal:** Provide deep analytical insights into conversion drivers through advanced data visualization, cohort analysis, and predictive scoring for hypothesis validation and optimization.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing analytics infrastructure with advanced visualization
- Maintain current reporting performance with enhanced analytics
- Preserve existing data export capabilities while adding journey analysis

## Story 5.1: Journey Comparison Analysis

As an admin,
I want side-by-side comparison of successful vs failed journeys,
so that I can understand specific factors that drive conversion differences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Visual journey comparison with highlighted differences in successful vs failed paths
2. Content diff analysis showing specific changes between journey versions
3. Timing comparison for engagement pattern analysis
4. Hypothesis comparison with outcome correlation data
5. Statistical significance testing for journey performance differences

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing journey viewing functionality maintained with comparison overlay
- IV2: Current data visualization performance preserved with advanced comparisons
- IV3: Journey loading times remain under 3 seconds for comparison views

## Story 5.2: Cohort Analysis by Hypothesis Type

As an admin,
I want cohort analysis of clients grouped by hypothesis type,
so that I can validate which strategic approaches work best for different client segments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Client segmentation by hypothesis categories (pricing, technical, relationship-focused)
2. Cohort conversion rate tracking over time with trend analysis
3. Hypothesis effectiveness scoring by client type and industry
4. Predictive modeling for hypothesis success based on client characteristics
5. Cohort retention and long-term value tracking beyond initial payment

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client categorization system preserved with cohort enhancement
- IV2: Current client listing performance maintained with cohort calculations
- IV3: Cohort analysis processing does not impact live admin dashboard performance

## Story 5.3: Predictive Hypothesis Scoring

As an admin,
I want predictive scoring for new hypotheses based on historical data,
so that I can prioritize the most promising approaches for each new client.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Machine learning model trained on historical hypothesis-outcome data
2. Predictive confidence scores for new hypothesis variations
3. Client similarity matching for hypothesis recommendation
4. A/B testing suggestions based on predictive model uncertainty
5. Continuous model improvement with new outcome data

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Hypothesis entry performance maintained with predictive scoring addition
- IV2: Existing content creation workflow preserved with scoring recommendations
- IV3: Predictive scoring calculations complete within 2 seconds of hypothesis entry
