# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI
All new revenue intelligence features will seamlessly integrate with the existing 40+ Shadcn/ui components and established Tailwind patterns. The learning capture interfaces will use existing form components (Input, Textarea, Button, Dialog, Toast) and maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes. New journey editor will utilize existing Tab, Card, and Modal patterns for multi-page editing workflow.

## Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Revenue Intelligence Dashboard:** Enhanced existing clients dashboard with journey status indicators and hypothesis tracking
- **Connected Journey Editor:** New multi-page editor using existing Tab navigation for 4-page journey management
- **Learning Capture Modal:** Overlay using existing Dialog component for quick hypothesis and outcome capture
- **Pattern Recognition View:** New dashboard section using existing Card and Chart patterns for viewing conversion intelligence

## UI Consistency Requirements
- All new UI elements must use existing Shadcn component variants and CVA patterns
- Dark mode support required using existing `dark:` classes across all new interfaces  
- Mobile responsiveness using existing Tailwind breakpoint system (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- Toast notifications using existing notification system for all user actions (success/error/info)
- Loading states using existing Skeleton components during pattern recognition updates
- Form validation patterns consistent with current React Hook Form + Zod implementation
