# Epic 7: AI-Powered Recommendations (Future)

**Epic Goal:** Implement advanced AI-driven optimization that automatically suggests optimal content, generates hypotheses, and provides predictive alerts based on comprehensive pattern analysis and client behavior prediction.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Integrate AI recommendations with existing content creation workflows
- Maintain current system performance with AI processing
- Preserve human decision-making authority while providing intelligent suggestions

## Story 7.1: Intelligent Content Optimization

As an admin,
I want AI to suggest optimal content for new clients based on their profile and historical success patterns,
so that I can start with the highest-probability approaches for each prospect.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Client profile analysis for content recommendation matching
2. AI-generated content suggestions based on successful pattern analysis
3. Confidence scoring for AI recommendations with explanation of reasoning
4. Human approval workflow for AI-suggested content changes
5. Continuous learning from admin decisions to improve AI recommendations

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing content creation workflow maintained with AI suggestion overlay
- IV2: Current content editing performance preserved with AI processing
- IV3: AI recommendation processing does not delay content creation workflows

## Story 7.2: Predictive Client Behavior Analysis

As an admin,
I want predictive alerts when a client might ghost and automated hypothesis generation based on client type,
so that I can intervene proactively and optimize approaches before problems occur.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Predictive modeling for client ghosting probability based on behavior patterns
2. Early warning alerts with recommended intervention strategies
3. Automatic hypothesis generation for new client types based on successful patterns
4. Behavioral anomaly detection for clients deviating from expected journey patterns
5. Proactive recommendation updates based on real-time client engagement analysis

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client monitoring workflows preserved with predictive enhancement
- IV2: Current alert system performance maintained with AI-generated predictions
- IV3: Predictive analysis processing does not impact live client experience

## Story 7.3: Autonomous Journey Optimization

As an admin,
I want the system to identify emerging patterns before they're obvious and provide automated journey optimization suggestions,
so that I can stay ahead of conversion trends and continuously improve performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Advanced pattern recognition for early trend identification
2. Automated optimization suggestions with risk assessment
3. Systematic experimentation recommendations based on pattern analysis
4. Emerging opportunity identification from client behavior analysis
5. Strategic recommendation reports for business model pivots and improvements

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing pattern recognition system enhanced with AI analysis
- IV2: Current optimization workflow preserved with automated suggestion integration
- IV3: AI optimization processing maintains system responsiveness and performance
