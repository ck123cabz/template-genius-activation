# Epic 6: Batch Intelligence Operations

**Epic Goal:** Enable efficient scaling of successful patterns through batch operations, template creation, and systematic application of proven approaches to multiple clients simultaneously.

**Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing bulk operations infrastructure with intelligence features
- Maintain current batch processing performance with pattern application
- Preserve existing client management workflows while adding template capabilities

## Story 6.1: Journey Template Creation and Application

As an admin,
I want to create templates from successful journeys and apply them to multiple new clients,
so that I can scale proven approaches efficiently without manual recreation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Template creation from successful journey with pattern preservation
2. Template library with success rate metadata and usage analytics
3. Bulk template application to multiple selected clients
4. Template customization options for client-specific modifications
5. Template performance tracking for continuous improvement

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client creation workflow maintained with template options
- IV2: Current bulk operations performance preserved with template application
- IV3: Template processing does not impact individual client journey performance

## Story 6.2: A/B Testing Framework

As an admin,
I want to create systematic A/B tests with different hypotheses and content variations,
so that I can scientifically validate which approaches drive better conversion rates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A/B test setup with hypothesis variants and success criteria
2. Automatic client assignment to test groups with balanced distribution
3. Statistical significance testing for A/B test results
4. Test duration optimization based on conversion rate patterns
5. Automated test conclusion with winner identification and rollout recommendations

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client assignment logic preserved with A/B test enhancement
- IV2: Current journey creation performance maintained with test framework
- IV3: A/B test processing does not affect live client experience

## Story 6.3: Bulk Intelligence Operations

As an admin,
I want to perform bulk updates on outcomes, segments, and template applications,
so that I can manage large numbers of clients efficiently while maintaining learning quality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Bulk outcome marking with pattern recognition for similar client groups
2. Intelligent client segmentation based on journey behavior patterns
3. Batch template updates with impact analysis before application
4. Bulk export of learning data for external analysis and reporting
5. Mass client communication based on journey stage and outcome patterns

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing bulk operation performance maintained with intelligence enhancement
- IV2: Current data export functionality preserved while adding journey-specific exports
- IV3: Bulk operations complete within acceptable timeframes without system impact
