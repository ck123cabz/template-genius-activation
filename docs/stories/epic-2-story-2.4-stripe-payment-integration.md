# Epic 2, Story 2.4: Automatic Stripe Payment Integration for Revenue Intelligence

## Story Overview
**Story ID**: 2.4  
**Epic**: 2 (Learning Capture System)  
**Priority**: HIGH (Epic 2 completion)  
**Estimated Points**: 8  

**User Story**: As an admin, I want outcomes automatically linked to Stripe payments so I have accurate revenue data correlated with journey content and learning hypotheses.

## Business Context
Story 2.4 completes Epic 2's comprehensive learning capture system by connecting payment events to journey outcomes, enabling true revenue intelligence. This bridges the gap between what we hypothesize will drive conversion and actual payment behavior.

### Epic 2 Foundation (Building Upon)
- **âœ… Story 2.1**: Hypothesis capture infrastructure established
- **âœ… Story 2.2**: Outcome marking with 5-tab OutcomeModal interface
- **âœ… Story 2.3**: Detailed learning notes and pattern recognition
- **ðŸŽ¯ Story 2.4**: Revenue correlation completing the intelligence loop

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Requirements
- [ ] **AC-2.4.1**: Stripe webhook integration captures payment events in real-time
- [ ] **AC-2.4.2**: Payment success automatically updates journey outcome to "paid" 
- [ ] **AC-2.4.3**: Payment metadata (amount, method, timestamp) linked to client journey
- [ ] **AC-2.4.4**: OutcomeModal displays payment status and revenue correlation
- [ ] **AC-2.4.5**: Failed/refunded payments update outcome status appropriately
- [ ] **AC-2.4.6**: Revenue intelligence dashboard shows payment-hypothesis correlation

### Revenue Intelligence Integration
- [ ] **AC-2.4.7**: Payment events trigger learning outcome analysis
- [ ] **AC-2.4.8**: Journey content correlated with successful payment patterns
- [ ] **AC-2.4.9**: Hypothesis validation includes payment conversion data
- [ ] **AC-2.4.10**: Pattern recognition identifies high-converting content variations

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **AC-2.4.11**: Secure webhook endpoint with proper Stripe signature verification
- [ ] **AC-2.4.12**: Database schema supports payment metadata storage
- [ ] **AC-2.4.13**: Server actions handle payment-outcome correlation
- [ ] **AC-2.4.14**: Real-time dashboard updates on payment events
- [ ] **AC-2.4.15**: Error handling for webhook failures and retry logic

## Technical Approach

### Database Schema Enhancement
```typescript
// New table: payment_intelligence
interface PaymentIntelligence {
  id: UUID;
  client_id: number;               // FK to clients
  stripe_payment_id: string;       // Stripe payment identifier
  amount: number;                  // Payment amount in cents
  currency: string;                // Payment currency
  payment_method: string;          // card, bank_transfer, etc.
  status: 'succeeded' | 'failed' | 'refunded' | 'disputed';
  stripe_customer_id?: string;     // Stripe customer ID
  journey_hypothesis: string;      // Hypothesis at time of payment
  conversion_factors: JSONB;       // Journey elements that influenced payment
  payment_timestamp: timestamp;
  webhook_processed_at: timestamp;
  created_at: timestamp;
}

// Enhanced clients table
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN:
  stripe_customer_id: string;      // Link to Stripe customer
  payment_status: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded' | 'failed';
  payment_amount?: number;         // Last payment amount
  payment_date?: timestamp;        // Last successful payment
```

### Stripe Webhook Integration
```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const signature = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  const body = await req.text();
  
  // Verify webhook signature
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
    body, 
    signature, 
    process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  );
  
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
      await handlePaymentSuccess(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'payment_intent.payment_failed':
      await handlePaymentFailure(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'charge.dispute.created':
      await handlePaymentDispute(event.data.object);
      break;
  }
  
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

### Enhanced Server Actions
```typescript
// lib/actions/payment-actions.ts
export async function processPaymentWebhook(
  paymentData: StripePaymentIntent
): Promise<PaymentProcessingResult> {
  // 1. Find client by Stripe customer or metadata
  // 2. Update journey outcome to 'paid'
  // 3. Record payment intelligence data
  // 4. Trigger learning analysis
  // 5. Update dashboard in real-time
}

export async function correlatePaymentWithJourney(
  clientId: number,
  paymentData: PaymentIntelligence
): Promise<RevenueCorrelation> {
  // Analyze which journey elements led to payment
  // Compare with hypothesis predictions
  // Generate learning insights
}
```

### OutcomeModal Enhancement (6th Tab)
Building on the existing 5-tab interface from Stories 2.2 & 2.3:
```typescript
// New "Payment" tab in OutcomeModal
<TabsList className="grid w-full grid-cols-6">
  <TabsTrigger value="outcome">Outcome</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="analysis">Analysis</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="correlation">Correlation</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="learning">Learning</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="notes">Notes</TabsTrigger>
  <TabsTrigger value="payment">Payment</TabsTrigger>  {/* NEW */}
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="payment">
  <PaymentIntelligenceView client={client} />
</TabsContent>
```

### Real-time Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Enhanced dashboard with payment status indicators
<ClientCard 
  client={client}
  showPaymentStatus={true}
  paymentCorrelation={paymentData}
/>

// Payment status badges
<Badge variant={client.payment_status === 'paid' ? 'success' : 'secondary'}>
  {client.payment_status === 'paid' 
    ? `Paid $${client.payment_amount/100}` 
    : 'Payment Pending'
  }
</Badge>
```
