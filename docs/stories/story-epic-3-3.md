### Core Technical Components

**Content Snapshot System:**
```typescript
// Enhanced content versioning with payment correlation
interface ContentSnapshot {
  id: string;
  contentVersionId: string;
  paymentSessionId: string;
  clientId: string;
  snapshotTimestamp: Date;
  contentData: {
    activationPageContent: string;
    agreementPageContent: string;

    contentVariationId?: string; // For A/B testing
  };
  paymentTiming: {
    contentLastModified: Date;
    paymentInitiated: Date;
    timeToPayment?: number; // milliseconds
  };
  performanceMetrics: {
    conversionRate?: number;
    avgTimeToPayment?: number;
    abTestVariant?: string;
  };
}

// Content snapshot creation at payment initiation
export async function createContentSnapshot(
  clientId: string, 
  paymentSessionId: string
): Promise<ContentSnapshot> {
  const activeContent = await db.contentVersions.findMany({
    where: { 
      clientId, 
      isCurrent: true 
    }
  });
  
  const snapshot = await db.contentSnapshots.create({
    data: {
      contentVersionId: activeContent[0].id,
      paymentSessionId,
      clientId,
      snapshotTimestamp: new Date(),
      contentData: {
        activationPageContent: activeContent.find(c => c.pageType === 'activation')?.content,
        agreementPageContent: activeContent.find(c => c.pageType === 'agreement')?.content,
        hypothesis: activeContent.find(c => c.pageType === 'activation')?.hypothesis,
        contentVariationId: activeContent[0].variationId
      },
      paymentTiming: {
        contentLastModified: activeContent[0].updatedAt,
        paymentInitiated: new Date()
      }
    }
  });
  
  return snapshot;
}
```

**Content-Payment Correlation Tracking:**
```typescript
interface ContentPaymentCorrelation {
  id: string;
  contentSnapshotId: string;
  paymentId: string;
  correlationMetrics: {
    timeToPayment: number; // milliseconds from content change to payment
    conversionOutcome: 'succeeded' | 'failed' | 'abandoned';
    contentVariation: string;
    hypothesisAccuracy?: number; // 0-1 score
  };
  performanceData: {
    contentScore: number; // Calculated performance score
    comparisonBaseline: number;
    improvementFactor: number;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Correlation calculation at payment completion
export async function calculateContentCorrelation(
  paymentId: string,
  outcome: 'succeeded' | 'failed'
): Promise<void> {
  const payment = await db.payments.findUnique({
    where: { id: paymentId },
    include: { 
      contentSnapshot: true,
      client: true
    }
  });
  
  const timeToPayment = payment.createdAt.getTime() - 
    payment.contentSnapshot.paymentTiming.contentLastModified.getTime();
  
  await db.contentPaymentCorrelations.create({
    data: {
      contentSnapshotId: payment.contentSnapshot.id,
      paymentId: payment.id,
      correlationMetrics: {
        timeToPayment,
        conversionOutcome: outcome,
        contentVariation: payment.contentSnapshot.contentData.contentVariationId || 'baseline'
      },
      performanceData: {
        contentScore: await calculateContentScore(payment.contentSnapshot),
        comparisonBaseline: await getBaselinePerformance(),
        improvementFactor: await calculateImprovementFactor(payment.contentSnapshot)
      }
    }
  });
}
```

**A/B Testing System:**
```typescript
interface ContentVariation {
  id: string;
  baseContentVersionId: string;
  variationName: string;
  testHypothesis: string;
  contentChanges: {
    pageType: 'activation' | 'agreement';
    elementChanges: {
      elementId: string;
      originalContent: string;
      variationContent: string;
      changeType: 'text' | 'style' | 'layout';
    }[];
  }[];
  testConfiguration: {
    trafficSplit: number; // 0-1, percentage of traffic to this variation
    startDate: Date;
    endDate?: Date;
    targetSampleSize: number;
    significanceThreshold: number; // 0.05 for 95% confidence
  };
  results: {
    impressions: number;
    conversions: number;
    conversionRate: number;
    avgTimeToPayment: number;
    statisticalSignificance: number;
    isWinner?: boolean;

export async function assignContentVariation(clientId: string): Promise<ContentVariation | null> {
  const activeTests = await db.contentVariations.findMany({
    where: {
      testConfiguration: {
        startDate: { lte: new Date() },
        endDate: { gte: new Date() }
      }
    }
  });
  
  // Weighted random assignment based on traffic split
  const selectedVariation = weightedRandomSelect(activeTests);
  
  if (selectedVariation) {
    // Apply variation to client's content
    await applyContentVariation(clientId, selectedVariation);
    
    // Track assignment
    await db.abTestAssignments.create({
      data: {
        clientId,
        variationId: selectedVariation.id,
        assignedAt: new Date()

export async function createContentSnapshotWithFallback(
  clientId: string, 
  paymentSessionId: string
): Promise<ContentSnapshot | null> {
  try {
    return await createContentSnapshot(clientId, paymentSessionId);
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error but don't block payment
    console.error('Content snapshot creation failed:', error);
    
    // Create minimal snapshot for correlation tracking
    return await createMinimalSnapshot(clientId, paymentSessionId);
  }
}
```

**A/B Test Assignment Failures:**
```typescript
// Graceful A/B test assignment with baseline fallback
export async function assignContentVariationSafe(clientId: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const variation = await assignContentVariation(clientId);
    if (!variation) {
      // No active tests, use baseline content
      await assignBaselineContent(clientId);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // A/B test system failure, fall back to baseline
    console.error('A/B test assignment failed:', error);
    await assignBaselineContent(clientId);
  }
}
```
