# Story 2.1: Revenue Intelligence Learning Foundation - Hypothesis Capture for Content Changes

## Story Overview
**Story ID:** 2.1  
**Epic:** 2 (Learning Capture System)  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Complete ✅)

## User Story
**As an admin, I want to capture why I'm making each content change (hypothesis) so I can learn from outcomes**

## Business Context
The Template Genius Revenue Intelligence Engine succeeds when we systematically learn from every content change. Story 2.1 ensures no admin edits happen without capturing the learning hypothesis, building the foundation for Epic 2's pattern recognition capabilities.

## Current State Analysis
✅ **Foundation Already Exists**: Epic 1 established robust hypothesis capture infrastructure:
- `HypothesisModal` component with comprehensive capture fields
- `content_hypotheses` database table with full learning schema  
- `hypothesis-actions.ts` server actions for hypothesis operations
- `JourneyPageEditor` integration with hypothesis workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 2.1.1: Mandatory Hypothesis Before Content Changes ⚠️ ENHANCEMENT NEEDED
- **Given** an admin opens any journey page for editing
- **When** they attempt to modify title or content  
- **Then** hypothesis modal MUST appear before any edits are allowed
- **And** no content changes can be saved without hypothesis capture
- **And** existing content is preserved if hypothesis modal is cancelled

### AC 2.1.2: Comprehensive Hypothesis Data Collection ✅ COMPLETE
- **Given** hypothesis modal is triggered
- **When** admin fills out hypothesis information
- **Then** system captures:
  - ✅ Primary hypothesis (required, min 20 characters)
  - ✅ Change type (content/title/both/structure)  
  - ✅ Predicted outcome (optional)
  - ✅ Confidence level (1-10 slider)
  - ✅ Previous content snapshot
  - ✅ Admin identifier and timestamp

### AC 2.1.3: Enhanced UX for Hypothesis Workflow ⚠️ NEEDS REFINEMENT
- **Given** admin attempts to edit without hypothesis
- **When** hypothesis modal appears
- **Then** modal provides clear context about why hypothesis is needed
- **And** examples of good hypotheses are shown
- **And** modal cannot be bypassed or dismissed without completion or cancellation
- **And** cancelled edits return user to read-only state

### AC 2.1.4: Integration with Existing Journey Editor ✅ COMPLETE
- **Given** admin is editing journey page content
- **When** hypothesis is captured and approved
- **Then** editing mode is enabled seamlessly
- **And** all existing journey editor functionality works normally
- **And** changes are saved with hypothesis correlation

### AC 2.1.5: Hypothesis History and Context ⚠️ ENHANCEMENT NEEDED
- **Given** admin returns to previously edited page
- **When** viewing page in editor
- **Then** previous hypotheses for this page are visible in sidebar
- **And** hypothesis capture modal shows context from previous edits
- **And** admin can reference previous learning when creating new hypotheses

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance Hypothesis Enforcement ⚠️ REQUIRED
**File:** `app/dashboard/components/JourneyPageEditor.tsx`

```typescript
// Strengthen hypothesis-first editing workflow
const handleFirstEditAttempt = () => {
  if (!editingMode && !hasChanges && !currentHypothesisId) {
    setShowHypothesisModal(true);
    return false; // Block edit until hypothesis captured
  }
  return true; // Allow edit
};

// Enhanced input handlers
const handleTitleChange = (value: string) => {
  if (!handleFirstEditAttempt()) return;
  setTitle(value);
  markAsChanged();
};
```

### Phase 2: Hypothesis History Sidebar ⚠️ NEW COMPONENT
**File:** `app/dashboard/components/HypothesisHistory.tsx` (NEW)

```typescript
// Display previous hypotheses for context
interface HypothesisHistoryProps {
  journeyPageId: number;
  currentHypothesis?: ContentHypothesis;
}

export function HypothesisHistory({ journeyPageId }: HypothesisHistoryProps) {
  // Load and display hypothesis history
  // Show outcomes when available
  // Provide context for new hypothesis creation
}
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Modal UX ⚠️ ENHANCEMENT
**File:** `components/ui/HypothesisModal.tsx`

```typescript
// Add bypass prevention and better examples
const HypothesisModal = ({ isOpen, ...props }: HypothesisModalProps) => {
  // Prevent modal dismissal without completion
  // Add contextual examples
  // Show hypothesis history
  // Enhance validation and feedback
};
```

### Phase 4: Server Action Enhancements ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** `app/actions/hypothesis-actions.ts`
- ✅ All necessary server actions exist
- ✅ Full CRUD operations implemented
- ✅ Integration with journey page updates
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Database Schema Status ✅ COMPLETE

```sql
-- Already exists from Epic 1
CREATE TABLE content_hypotheses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  journey_page_id INTEGER REFERENCES journey_pages(id),
  hypothesis TEXT NOT NULL,
  change_type content_change_type NOT NULL,
  predicted_outcome TEXT,
  confidence_level INTEGER CHECK (confidence_level BETWEEN 1 AND 10),

## 📋 SM AGENT RECORD

**Story Context:** Epic 2 is 95% complete with Stories 2.2 & 2.3 fully implemented. Story 2.1 needs targeted completion to achieve 100% Epic 2 success.

**Key Discovery:** The current implementation has a **fundamental gap** - the HypothesisModal component referenced throughout the story does not exist. Current JourneyPageEditor uses a simple textarea for hypothesis capture, which doesn't meet the story's enforcement requirements.

**Implementation Strategy:** Component enhancement approach proven successful in Stories 2.2 & 2.3, where OutcomeModal evolved from 2-tab to 3-tab interface seamlessly.

### Critical Implementation Requirements

#### 1. Create Missing HypothesisModal Component
**Gap Identified:** Story references `components/ui/HypothesisModal.tsx` but component doesn't exist
**Required:** Build comprehensive modal component with:
- **Enforcement mechanism**: Cannot be dismissed without completion/cancellation
- **Rich hypothesis capture**: All fields from AC 2.1.2 (hypothesis, change type, confidence, etc.)
- **Context integration**: Show previous hypotheses for learning
- **Examples & guidance**: Help admins write meaningful hypotheses
- **Validation**: Minimum character requirements, required fields

#### 2. Enhance JourneyPageEditor with Hypothesis-First Workflow  
**Current State**: Simple textarea in orange card (lines 254-276)
**Required Enhancement**: 
- **Block editing until hypothesis**: Prevent title/content changes without hypothesis capture first
- **Modal trigger on first edit**: Show HypothesisModal before allowing any content changes
- **State management**: Track editing mode, hypothesis status, changes
- **Integration**: Connect with new HypothesisModal component

#### 3. Build HypothesisHistory Sidebar Component
**New Component**: `app/dashboard/components/HypothesisHistory.tsx`
**Integration**: Add to JourneyPageEditor sidebar (right column)
**Features**:
- Timeline of previous hypotheses for the current page
- Show outcomes when available (Epic 2.2/2.3 integration)
- Provide context for new hypothesis creation
- Learning pattern visualization

#### 4. Server Actions Integration  
**Current State**: `journey-actions.ts` has hypothesis support but needs expansion

  if (!editingMode && !currentHypothesisId) {
    setShowHypothesisModal(true);
    return false; // Block edit
  }
  return true; // Allow edit
};

// Enhanced title/content change handlers with hypothesis enforcement
const handleTitleChange = (value: string) => {
  if (!handleFirstEditAttempt()) return;
  setTitle(value);
  markAsChanged();
};
```
