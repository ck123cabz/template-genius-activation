- **Story 2.1**: Mandatory hypothesis capture before content changes (9/10 QA)
- **Story 2.2**: Dashboard outcome marking with visual indicators (8.5/10 QA)  
- **Story 2.3**: Detailed notes with 7 comprehensive fields (7.5/10 QA)
- **Story 2.4**: Stripe integration with payment-outcome correlation (8.5-9/10 QA)

**Technical Assets Available**:
- OutcomeModal.tsx with 6-tab interface (Outcome/Analysis/Correlation/Learning/Notes/Payment)
- Complete learning workflow: hypothesis → outcome → notes → payment correlation
- Server actions pattern across all learning operations

## Technical Implementation

### Integration Points with Existing Epic 2 Infrastructure

#### 1. Server Actions Enhancement
**File**: `/app/lib/actions/learning-actions.ts` (extend existing)
```typescript
// Add Serena memory integration to existing server actions
import { mcp__serena__write_memory } from '@anthropic/mcp-serena';

export async function captureHypothesisWithMemory(hypothesisData: HypothesisData) {
  // Existing hypothesis capture logic...
  const result = await captureHypothesis(hypothesisData);
  
  // NEW: Memory persistence
  await updateLearningMemory('hypothesis_patterns', {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    clientId: hypothesisData.clientId,
    hypothesis: hypothesisData.hypothesis,
    journeyStage: hypothesisData.journeyStage,
    expectedOutcome: hypothesisData.expectedOutcome
  });
  
  return result;
}
```

#### 2. OutcomeModal Integration
**File**: `/app/components/dashboard/OutcomeModal.tsx` (enhance existing)
```typescript
// Extend existing 6-tab modal with memory updates
const handleOutcomeSubmit = async (outcomeData: OutcomeData) => {
  // Existing outcome capture logic...
  await captureOutcome(outcomeData);
  
  // NEW: Trigger memory update with learning correlation
  await updateLearningMemory('outcome_patterns', {
    outcomeType: outcomeData.outcome,
    conversionSuccess: outcomeData.outcome === 'conversion',
    journeyStage: outcomeData.journeyStage,
    paymentCorrelation: outcomeData.paymentAmount,
    learningNotes: outcomeData.detailedNotes,
    patterns: identifyPatterns(outcomeData)
  });
};
```

#### 3. Memory Organization Strategy
**Memory File Structure**:
- `learning_patterns_summary.md` - Consolidated insights across all learning
- `hypothesis_success_patterns.md` - Successful hypothesis → outcome correlations
- `conversion_intelligence.md` - Payment timing and journey optimization insights
- `content_effectiveness_analysis.md` - Which content drives revenue by stage
- `epic_2_implementation_learnings.md` - Development patterns and system insights

#### 4. Memory Update Triggers
**Learning Events That Trigger Memory Updates**:
- **Hypothesis Creation** (Story 2.1) → Update hypothesis pattern memory
- **Outcome Marking** (Story 2.2) → Update conversion pattern memory  
- **Detailed Notes** (Story 2.3) → Update insight analysis memory
- **Payment Correlation** (Story 2.4) → Update revenue intelligence memory
- **Pattern Recognition** → Update consolidated learning summaries

### Memory Content Structure

#### Example Memory File: `learning_patterns_summary.md`
```markdown
