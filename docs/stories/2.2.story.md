# Story 2.2: Journey Outcome Tracking

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As an** admin,  
**I want** to mark journey outcomes (paid/ghosted/responded) with detailed notes,  
**so that** I can identify patterns and understand what makes clients convert.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Outcome marking available from dashboard (paid/ghosted/pending/responded)
2. Outcome notes field for detailed learning capture explaining what happened
3. Outcome timestamp tracking for conversion analysis
4. Bulk outcome marking for efficiency with multiple clients
5. Outcome history visible in client journey view

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Dashboard performance remains unchanged with outcome tracking addition
- IV2: Existing client status indicators continue to work alongside outcome markers
- IV3: Current dashboard filtering and sorting preserved with new outcome data

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Extend Client model with outcome tracking fields (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Add outcome enum ('paid', 'ghosted', 'pending', 'responded') to Client interface
  - [ ] Add outcome_timestamp field for tracking when outcome was marked
  - [ ] Add outcome_notes text field for detailed learning capture
  - [ ] Update client database schema with new outcome fields
- [ ] Task 2: Enhance Dashboard ClientList with outcome marking UI (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [ ] Add outcome status badges alongside existing status indicators  
  - [ ] Implement individual outcome marking dropdown per client row
  - [ ] Add bulk outcome marking checkbox selection with batch action
  - [ ] Integrate outcome notes modal with textarea for detailed capture
  - [ ] Preserve existing dashboard filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Task 3: Create server actions for outcome management (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Implement markClientOutcome server action with validation
  - [ ] Implement bulkMarkClientOutcomes server action for efficiency
  - [ ] Add outcome timestamp tracking on server-side operations
  - [ ] Ensure atomic transaction handling for bulk operations
- [ ] Task 4: Add outcome history to client journey view (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Extend existing ContentHistoryPanel with outcome timeline
  - [ ] Display outcome changes with timestamps and notes
  - [ ] Show outcome progression alongside content version history
  - [ ] Maintain professional styling consistent with existing journey components
- [ ] Task 5: Testing and Integration Verification (All IVs)
  - [ ] Unit test outcome marking server actions with mock data fallbacks
  - [ ] Playwright MCP testing for dashboard outcome marking functionality
  - [ ] Performance testing to ensure dashboard remains responsive
  - [ ] Regression testing for existing client status and filtering functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Learnings
From Epic 1 completion, the following established patterns must be followed:
- **Component Enhancement Pattern**: Extend existing ClientList component rather than creating new one (proven successful in Epic 1)
- **Server Action Architecture**: Use FormData patterns with validation, atomic transactions, and revalidatePath calls
- **Mock Data Integration**: Ensure development environment fallbacks support new outcome fields
- **Professional UI Standards**: Maintain Shadcn UI consistency with Badge, Dialog, Button components

### Data Models
**Enhanced Client Model** (extends existing Epic 1 client structure):  
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#enhanced-client-model]
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: UUID;
  company: string;
  contact: string; 
  email: string;
  activationToken: string;        // G[4-digit] format from Epic 1
  currentVersionId?: UUID;        // Links to active content version from Epic 1
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'paid' | 'failed';  // Existing from Epic 1
  // New fields for Story 2.2:
  outcome?: 'paid' | 'ghosted' | 'pending' | 'responded';
  outcome_timestamp?: Date;
  outcome_notes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Database Schema Changes Required**:  
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#migration-strategy]
```sql
-- Add outcome tracking fields to existing clients table
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN outcome VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN outcome_timestamp TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN outcome_notes TEXT;
```

### API Specifications
**Server Actions Required** (following Epic 1 patterns):  
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#client-management-server-actions]

```typescript
// Individual outcome marking
export async function markClientOutcome(
  clientId: string, 
  outcome: 'paid' | 'ghosted' | 'pending' | 'responded',
  notes?: string
): Promise<Client> {
  // Atomic update with timestamp and revalidation
}

// Bulk outcome marking
export async function bulkMarkClientOutcomes(
  clientIds: string[],
  outcome: 'paid' | 'ghosted' | 'pending' | 'responded', 
  notes?: string
): Promise<Client[]> {
  // Transaction-based bulk update with individual timestamps
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Enhanced ClientList Component** (extends Epic 1 component):  
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#enhanced-clientlist-component]
- Maintain existing features: journey progress, hypothesis tracking, professional navigation
- Add outcome status badges alongside existing status indicators
- Implement individual outcome dropdown per client row
- Add bulk selection with outcome marking actions
- Preserve all existing ClientList functionality and performance

**ContentHistoryPanel Enhancement**:  
- Extend existing panel from Epic 1 with outcome timeline
- Display outcome changes alongside content version history
- Maintain professional styling with existing design system

### File Locations
Based on established Epic 1 patterns:
- Extend: `app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx`
- Extend: `app/components/ContentHistoryPanel.tsx` 
- New: `app/actions/outcome-actions.ts`
- Update: `lib/data-layers/version-data-layer.ts` (add outcome methods)
- Database: Migration file in `supabase/migrations/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** (following Epic 1 proven patterns):  
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-tests]
- **Unit Tests**: Server action testing with Jest for outcome marking logic
- **Playwright MCP**: Browser automation testing for dashboard outcome UI
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure dashboard responsiveness maintained with new outcome data
- **Regression Testing**: Verify existing client status and filtering continue working

### Technical Constraints
- **TypeScript Strict Compliance**: 100% compilation success required (Epic 1 standard)
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Follow established validation patterns for outcome forms
- **Mock Data Support**: Ensure development environment works with new outcome fields
- **Database Transactions**: Use atomic operations for bulk outcome marking
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Maintain Tailwind responsive patterns for outcome UI

### Integration Notes
- **Dashboard Performance**: New outcome data must not impact existing dashboard loading speeds (IV1)
- **Status Coexistence**: Outcome markers work alongside existing client status indicators (IV2) 
- **Filtering Preservation**: Current dashboard filtering and sorting must be preserved (IV3)
- **Professional Standards**: Follow 94% quality score benchmark established in Epic 1

## Testing
**Test Standards from Architecture**:  
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit-tests-for-new-components]
- **Location**: `__tests__/` directories alongside enhanced components
- **Framework**: Playwright MCP for browser automation, Jest for server actions
- **Coverage**: 80% coverage for outcome management functionality
- **Integration**: End-to-end outcome marking and bulk operations testing

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Individual outcome marking UI interaction testing
- Bulk outcome marking with multiple client selection
- Outcome notes modal functionality and data persistence
- Outcome history display in client journey view
- Performance impact assessment for dashboard with outcome data

- React Hook Form + Zod validation with Shadcn UI integration (use for outcome forms)
- TypeScript strict compliance patterns (maintain 100% success rate)
