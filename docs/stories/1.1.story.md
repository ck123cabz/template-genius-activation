# Story 1.1: Client Creation with Journey Hypothesis Tracking

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** admin,
**I want** to create clients with an overall journey hypothesis and automatic 4-page setup,
**so that** I can systematically track my conversion strategy from the moment I engage each prospect.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Client creation form includes required "Overall Journey Hypothesis" field with clear prompting
2. System automatically creates all 4 journey pages (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) when client is created
3. Each page receives default content structure while maintaining existing G[4-digit] token system  
4. Client dashboard shows journey status indicators alongside existing client information
5. Hypothesis field supports rich text entry up to 500 characters for detailed strategy capture

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing client creation flow continues to work without the hypothesis field for backward compatibility
- IV2: Mock data system creates journey structure alongside client data without database dependency
- IV3: Current client listing and management functionality remains unchanged after enhancement

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the foundational client-journey infrastructure for the Revenue Intelligence Engine. The system transforms from simple client management to hypothesis-driven conversion tracking.

### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#enhanced-client-model]
**Enhanced Client Model:**
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: UUID;
  company: string;
  contact: string;
  email: string;
  journeyHypothesis: string;        // NEW: Overall conversion strategy (max 500 chars)
  activationToken: string;          // G[4-digit] format with collision detection
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  createdAt: Date;
  // Existing fields preserved
}
```

**Journey Page Structure:**
Each client automatically gets 4 journey pages created:
- `activation` - Initial client landing/engagement page
- `agreement` - Terms and engagement agreement
- `confirmation` - Payment confirmation and next steps
- `processing` - Final processing and completion

### API Specifications [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#client-management-server-actions]
**Primary Server Action:**
```typescript
export async function createClientWithJourneyHypothesis(formData: FormData): Promise<ClientCreationResult> {
  // 1. Validate form data including hypothesis (max 500 chars)
  // 2. Generate unique G[4-digit] activation token
  // 3. Create client record atomically
  // 4. Auto-create all 4 journey pages with default content
  // 5. Link pages with proper navigation structure
  // 6. Return client + journey page references
}
```

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#enhanced-clientlist-component]
**ClientList Enhancement Location:** `app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx`
- Extend existing creation form with hypothesis textarea
- Add journey status indicators using existing Badge components
- Preserve all existing client information display
- Use existing Shadcn UI components (Card, Button, Dialog, Table, Badge)

**Form Integration Pattern:**
- React Hook Form + Zod validation (existing pattern)
- FormData submission to server actions (existing pattern)  
- useFormState/useFormStatus for loading states (existing pattern)

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
**Enhancement Locations:**
- Client Interface: Extend existing interfaces in `lib/types.ts` or similar
- Server Actions: `app/actions/client-actions.ts` (enhance existing)
- Component: `app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx` (enhance existing)
- Validation: `lib/validation/client-schemas.ts` (new - Zod schemas)
- Journey Actions: `app/actions/journey-actions.ts` (enhance existing)

**File Structure Alignment:**
- Follows existing kebab-case TypeScript convention
- Uses existing barrel exports and path aliases (@/lib, @/components)
- Maintains existing dashboard component organization

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#existing-technology-stack]
- **TypeScript 5.7** - Strict mode compliance required
- **Next.js 15.2.4** - App Router patterns, Server Actions preferred
- **React Hook Form 7.60.0** - Form management (existing pattern)
- **Zod 3.25.67** - Validation schemas (existing pattern)
- **Shadcn UI** - Use existing 40+ components, no new component additions needed
- **Tailwind CSS** - Consistent styling patterns, no new utilities needed

### Business Logic Requirements
- **G[4-digit] Token Generation:** Must be unique across all clients, format 'G' + 4 digits (G0001-G9999)
- **Journey Hypothesis:** Rich text field, 500 character limit, required field with clear prompting
- **Auto-Journey Creation:** All 4 pages created automatically, linked navigation structure
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing clients without hypothesis must continue functioning
- **Status Tracking:** New clients start as 'pending', progress through lifecycle

### Integration Dependencies  
- **Existing Mock Data System:** Must work without database changes during development
- **Existing Client Management:** All current functionality preserved
- **G[4-digit] Token System:** Existing token handling maintained and extended
- **Dashboard Layout:** Current dashboard component structure preserved
