# Story 2.3: Automatic Payment-Outcome Correlation

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As the** system,  
**I want** to automatically link Stripe payments to journey outcomes,  
**so that** learning data is accurate and admins don't need manual correlation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Stripe webhook updates journey outcome automatically on payment success
2. Payment metadata includes journey ID and content version for correlation
3. Failed payments trigger appropriate outcome status updates
4. Payment timing data captured for time-to-conversion analysis
5. Manual outcome override available for edge cases

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Create Stripe Webhook Handler** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` webhook endpoint
  - [ ] Implement webhook signature verification using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  - [ ] Handle `checkout.session.completed` event for successful payments
  - [ ] Handle `checkout.session.expired` and `payment_intent.payment_failed` events
  - [ ] Extract `clientId` and `contentVersionId` from session metadata
  - [ ] Call `markJourneyOutcome` server action with automatic outcome update

- [ ] **Task 2: Enhance Payment Session Creation** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Modify existing `createPaymentSession` server action in `app/actions/client-actions.ts`
  - [ ] Add current `contentVersionId` to Stripe session metadata
  - [ ] Include `clientId` in session metadata for webhook correlation
  - [ ] Ensure payment session links to client's active content version at payment time

- [ ] **Task 3: Automatic Outcome Update Integration** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Extend existing `markJourneyOutcome` server action to accept automatic updates
  - [ ] Add payment timestamp to outcome tracking for conversion analysis
  - [ ] Implement automatic outcome status: `paid` for successful payments
  - [ ] Add automatic outcome notes: "Payment completed via Stripe webhook"
  - [ ] Preserve existing manual outcome override functionality

- [ ] **Task 4: Failed Payment Handling** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Implement failed payment outcome updates in webhook handler
  - [ ] Set outcome status to `ghosted` for expired sessions
  - [ ] Set outcome status to `pending` for failed payment attempts
  - [ ] Add descriptive outcome notes for different failure types

- [ ] **Task 5: Environment Configuration** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to environment configuration
  - [ ] Update `.env.example` with webhook secret placeholder
  - [ ] Configure webhook endpoint URL in Stripe dashboard (development notes)

- [ ] **Task 6: Integration Testing** (AC: 1-5)
  - [ ] Test successful payment webhook processing
  - [ ] Test failed payment webhook processing  
  - [ ] Verify manual outcome override still functions
  - [ ] Test payment-outcome correlation accuracy
  - [ ] Verify existing payment flow remains unmodified

## Dev Notes

### **Previous Story Insights**
From Epic 2 Story 2.2 implementation:
- **Enhanced ClientList Component**: Located at `app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx` with outcome tracking UI (paid/ghosted/pending/responded status markers)
- **Outcome Server Actions**: `markJourneyOutcome` and `bulkMarkOutcomes` server actions exist with comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Outcome Status Enum**: Standardized outcome types already implemented with TypeScript interfaces
- **OutcomeHistoryPanel**: Timeline display component for outcome progression tracking
- **Mock Data System**: Comprehensive fallback support for outcome tracking during development

### **Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#payment-records-model]
- **Enhanced Client Model**: `outcome_status`, `outcome_notes`, `outcome_timestamp` fields available
- **Payment Records Model**: Links payments to content versions for precise conversion analytics
- **Payment Schema**: `client_id`, `content_version_id`, `stripe_payment_intent_id`, `amount`, `status`, `created_at`

### **API Specifications** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#stripe-webhook-handler]
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Handle Stripe payment confirmations
- **Authentication**: Stripe webhook signature verification using `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()`
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with 400 status for invalid signatures
- **Event Handling**: Support for `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

### **Component Specifications** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#payment-processing-server-actions]
- **Payment Session Creation**: `createPaymentSession(clientId: string)` server action exists
- **Session Metadata**: Already includes `clientId` in metadata, needs `contentVersionId` addition
- **Content Version Correlation**: Payment must link to client's active content version at payment time

### **File Locations** [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]
- **Webhook Handler**: Create `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (new directory structure)
- **Server Actions**: Enhance existing `app/actions/client-actions.ts` with payment session metadata
- **Outcome Actions**: Extend existing outcome server actions for automatic updates

### **Technical Constraints** [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#required-new-dependencies]
- **Stripe SDK**: Use existing `stripe` package (^14.21.0) for webhook processing
- **TypeScript Support**: Leverage existing `@types/stripe` (^8.0.0) for type safety
- **Environment Variables**: Use existing `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, add `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Testing

### **Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-tests]
- **Framework**: Playwright MCP for end-to-end webhook testing
- **Location**: `__tests__/` directories alongside enhanced components
- **Coverage**: 90% coverage requirement for payment processing integration
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end payment and outcome correlation flows

### **Specific Testing Requirements**
- **Webhook Security**: Test signature verification and invalid signature rejection
- **Payment Correlation**: Verify payment metadata correctly links to content versions
- **Outcome Updates**: Test automatic outcome status updates for success/failure scenarios
- **Manual Override**: Ensure existing manual outcome functionality remains intact
- **Performance**: Maintain existing payment flow performance with metadata addition

## Previous Story Learnings
Components established in Story 2.2:
- **Enhanced ClientList**: Outcome tracking UI with status markers ready for automatic updates
- **Outcome Server Actions**: `markJourneyOutcome` action available for webhook integration
- **Professional Integration**: Seamless dashboard integration patterns proven effective
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select outcome marking system for admin efficiency
- **OutcomeHistoryPanel**: Timeline display ready to show automatic vs manual outcome updates

Architectural decisions from Story 2.2:
- **Outcome Status Enum**: Standardized types (paid, ghosted, pending, responded) align with webhook updates
- **Timestamp Precision**: Millisecond precision tracking supports payment timing analysis
- **Server Action Patterns**: Atomic operations with validation/error handling ready for webhook calls
- **Dashboard Performance**: Optimized patterns maintain speed with automatic outcome updates

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Despite claims of completion, Story 2.3 implementation is NOT present in the codebase. Review conducted against story requirements and architectural specifications.

**Expected Implementation Status**: Story requires Stripe webhook integration for automatic payment-outcome correlation, but no webhook handler or payment correlation logic exists in the codebase.

### Missing Implementation Analysis

**Task 1: Stripe Webhook Handler** - MISSING
- Expected: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - File does not exist
- No Stripe webhook signature verification implementation
- No event handling for `checkout.session.completed` or payment failures

**Task 2: Payment Session Enhancement** - MISSING  
- Expected: Enhanced `createPaymentSession` in `app/actions/client-actions.ts` - Function does not exist
- No metadata correlation for `clientId` and `contentVersionId`

**Task 3: Automatic Outcome Updates** - MISSING
- Expected: `markJourneyOutcome` server action - Function does not exist
- No automatic payment timestamp tracking
- No outcome status automation

**Task 4: Failed Payment Handling** - MISSING
- No webhook processing for expired sessions or failed payments

**Task 5: Environment Configuration** - INCOMPLETE
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable not configured

- Outcome tracking fields in client records
- Payment metadata for webhook correlation

**API Design**: Missing critical payment processing infrastructure:
- Stripe webhook endpoint with signature verification
- Payment session creation with metadata
- Outcome marking server actions

**Security Considerations**: Unaddressed security requirements:
- Webhook signature verification for authenticity
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Error handling for payment processing failures

### Performance Implications

**Risk Assessment**: If implemented as specified:
- Webhook processing could introduce latency if not properly async
- Database writes on every payment event require optimization
- Missing rate limiting on webhook endpoints

### Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**:

1. **Implement Core Payment Infrastructure**
   - Create `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` with signature verification
   - Add `createPaymentSession` and `markJourneyOutcome` server actions

### Review Date: 2025-01-30 (RE-REVIEW AFTER DEV AGENT FIXES)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### CRITICAL RE-REVIEW FINDINGS

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: Despite claims of completion and fixes by Dev Agent, comprehensive codebase analysis reveals **ZERO IMPLEMENTATION** of Story 2.3 requirements.

### Code Quality Assessment

**COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED**:
- ✅ **Searched entire `/app` directory structure** - No API routes exist

- ✅ **Verified payment correlation functions** - None implemented
- ✅ **Checked outcome tracking systems** - Only UI simulation exists

**MISSING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE**:

1. **❌ STRIPE WEBHOOK HANDLER** - STILL MISSING
   - Expected: `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
   - **Reality**: No `/app/api/` directory exists in codebase
   - No webhook signature verification
   - No event processing logic

2. **❌ PAYMENT SESSION FUNCTIONS** - STILL MISSING  
   - Expected: `createPaymentSession` in `app/actions/client-actions.ts`

2. **AC2: Payment metadata includes journey ID** → ❌ **NO METADATA CORRELATION** 
3. **AC3: Failed payments trigger outcome updates** → ❌ **NO FAILURE HANDLING**
4. **AC4: Payment timing data captured** → ❌ **NO TIMING ANALYTICS**
5. **AC5: Manual outcome override available** → ❌ **NO OUTCOME SYSTEM**

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: **✗** No implementation to evaluate
- Project Structure: **✗** Required API infrastructure missing

- Missing authentication for webhook endpoints

### Integration Risk Assessment

**EPIC 2 COMPLETION RISK**: **CRITICAL**
- Final Epic 2 story claimed complete but entirely unimplemented
- Revenue Intelligence Engine lacks payment correlation capability  
- Learning Capture System missing automatic payment outcome updates
- Dashboard analytics cannot capture payment conversion data

### Files Modified During Review

*No modifications possible - implementation does not exist*

### Gate Status  

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.3-automatic-payment-outcome-correlation.yml

**BLOCKING ISSUES**:
1. **ZERO IMPLEMENTATION** of all 6 required tasks
2. **NO STRIPE WEBHOOK INFRASTRUCTURE** exists in codebase
3. **NO PAYMENT CORRELATION SYSTEM** implemented  
4. **NO AUTOMATIC OUTCOME TRACKING** functionality
5. **MISSING SECURITY MEASURES** for payment processing
6. **NO DATABASE SCHEMA** for payment-journey correlation

### Recommended Status

**✗ IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED - STORY NOT STARTED**

This story requires **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION** from ground zero:

**REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION**:
1. **Create `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`** with signature verification
2. **Add payment server actions** in `app/actions/client-actions.ts`
3. **Implement outcome tracking system** with database integration
4. **Add payment-journey correlation** with metadata handling
5. **Create failed payment processing** logic
6. **Add environment configuration** for webhook secrets
7. **Implement comprehensive testing** for all payment flows

**EPIC 2 CANNOT BE MARKED COMPLETE** until Story 2.3 is actually implemented.

**Quality Gate Decision**: **CRITICAL FAIL** - Claims of completion are not supported by codebase evidence. This story requires full implementation before it can be considered for completion.
