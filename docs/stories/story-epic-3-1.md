## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Story 3.1 implements secure Stripe Checkout integration as the foundation of Epic 3's Payment Intelligence system. This story establishes the core payment processing capability that enables revenue collection while capturing journey metadata for conversion intelligence analysis.

### Previous Story Dependencies & Integration Strategy
- **Stories 1.1-1.4**: Complete client journey system with G-token activation flow
- **Stories 2.1-2.3**: Learning capture system with comprehensive outcome tracking
  - **Story 2.3 Foundation (CRITICAL)**: Payment correlation infrastructure already exists
    - `payment_outcome_correlations` table established
    - Enhanced webhook handlers in `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
    - Payment metadata correlation system in `/lib/payment-metadata.ts`
    - Correlation server actions in `/app/actions/correlation-actions.ts`
    - OutcomeModal with correlation management interface

**Integration Enhancement Strategy:**
Story 3.1 extends the existing Story 2.3 payment correlation foundation by adding front-end checkout functionality. The webhook infrastructure and correlation system are already implemented - this story adds the client-facing payment interface.

### Core Technical Components

**Stripe Integration Architecture:**
```typescript
// Client-side Stripe configuration
interface StripeConfig {
  publishableKey: string;
  appearance: StripeElementsOptions['appearance'];
  clientSecret?: string;
}

// Server-side payment session creation
interface PaymentSessionData {
  clientId: string;
  amount: number; // $500 = 50000 cents
  currency: 'usd';
  metadata: {
    client_id: string;
    journey_id: string;
    content_version_id: string;
    journey_hypothesis: string;
    page_sequence: string;
    conversion_timing: string;
  };
}

// Enhanced payment session with journey correlation
interface EnhancedPaymentSession {
  sessionId: string;
  sessionUrl: string;
  clientSecret: string;
  metadata: PaymentSessionData['metadata'];
}
```
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#payment-processing-server-actions]

**Server Action Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Payment session creation server action
export async function createPaymentSession(clientId: string): Promise<PaymentSessionResult> {
  const client = await db.clients.findUnique({
    where: { id: clientId },
    include: { currentVersion: true }
  });
  
  // Get current content version for metadata correlation
  const activeVersion = await db.contentVersions.findFirst({
    where: { 
      clientId: client.id, 
      pageType: 'activation', 
      isCurrent: true 
    }
  });
  
  // Create Stripe checkout session with journey metadata
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    line_items: [{
      price_data: {
        currency: 'usd',
        product_data: {
          name: 'Priority Access Activation',
          description: 'Genius recruitment priority access'
        },
        unit_amount: 50000 // $500.00
      },
      quantity: 1
    }],
    mode: 'payment',
    success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/confirmation?client=${clientId}`,
    cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/activate/${client.activationToken}`,
    metadata: {
      clientId: client.id,
      contentVersionId: activeVersion?.id || '', // Links payment to exact content version
      journeyHypothesis: activeVersion?.hypothesis || '',
      pageSequence: JSON.stringify(['activation', 'agreement']),
      conversionTiming: Date.now().toString()
    }
  });
  
  return { 
    success: true, 
    sessionUrl: session.url,
    sessionId: session.id 
  };
}
```
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#payment-processing-server-actions]

**Component Integration Pattern:**
```typescript
// Payment button component following existing patterns
function PaymentButton({ clientId }: { clientId: string }) {
  const [pending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  
  const handlePayment = () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      const result = await createPaymentSession(clientId);
      if (result.sessionUrl) {
        window.location.href = result.sessionUrl;
      }
    });
  };
  
  return (
    <Button 
      onClick={handlePayment} 
      disabled={pending}
      className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white"
    >
      {pending ? 'Processing...' : 'Pay $500 Activation Fee'}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

{
  "@stripe/stripe-js": "^2.4.0",
  "stripe": "^14.21.0", 
  "@types/stripe": "^8.0.0"
}
```

### File Structure & Integration Points
**New Files:**
- `/lib/stripe.ts` - Stripe client configuration
- `/app/actions/payment-actions.ts` - Payment session server actions
- Payment component integration in journey pages

**Enhanced Files:**
- `/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Add checkout.session.completed handling (builds on Story 2.3)
- Journey page components - Add PaymentButton integration
- `/app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx` - Add payment status indicators

[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]

### Integration with Story 2.3 Foundation
**Existing Infrastructure to Leverage:**
- Payment correlation database schema already implemented
- Webhook processing infrastructure established
- Metadata extraction and correlation system operational
- OutcomeModal with payment correlation interface

**Story 3.1 Enhancement Strategy:**
- Extend existing webhook handlers with checkout session events
- Utilize existing payment correlation server actions
- Build on established metadata embedding patterns
- Integrate with existing outcome tracking system

### Error Handling & Security Requirements
**PCI Compliance:**
- All payment processing handled by Stripe (no card data storage)
- Webhook signature validation required
- HTTPS enforcement for all payment pages
- Environment variable security for API keys

**Error Handling Patterns:**
```typescript
// Payment error handling with user feedback
interface PaymentResult {
  success: boolean;
  sessionUrl?: string;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    retryable: boolean;
  };
}

// Graceful failure with retry options
if (!result.success && result.error?.retryable) {
  // Show retry button with user-friendly error message
  setError(`Payment failed: ${result.error.message}. Please try again.`);
}
```
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#critical-integration-rules]

### Performance Requirements
- Page loading time under 3 seconds (IV3 requirement)
- Checkout session creation under 1 second
- Webhook processing under 500ms (maintains Story 2.3 performance)
- Minimal impact on existing client journey flow

### Testing Standards
**Framework:** Playwright MCP for payment flow testing and webhook simulation
**Coverage Requirements:** 90% coverage for payment components, 95% for server actions

**Testing Strategy:**
```javascript
// End-to-end payment testing with Playwright MCP
describe('Payment Flow Integration', () => {
  test('Complete payment journey with metadata correlation', async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to client activation page
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/activate/G1234');
    
    // Progress through journey to payment
    await page.click('[data-testid="continue-button"]');
    await page.waitForURL('**/agreement/**');
    
    // Initiate payment with metadata capture
    await page.click('[data-testid="payment-button"]');
    
    // Verify Stripe checkout redirect
    await page.waitForURL('**/checkout.stripe.com/**');
    
    // Simulate payment completion (test mode)
    // Verify correlation creation and client status update
  });
});
```
