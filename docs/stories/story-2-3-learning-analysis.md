## Technical Requirements

### Database Views and Analytics
```sql
-- Learning correlation view
CREATE VIEW learning_correlations AS
SELECT 
  c.id as client_id,
  c.company_name,
  c.journey_hypothesis,
  ch.hypothesis_text,
  ch.change_type,
  ch.confidence_level,
  jo.conversion_status,
  jo.outcome_notes,
  jo.outcome_value,
  (jo.created_at - c.created_at) as journey_duration
FROM clients c
LEFT JOIN content_hypotheses ch ON c.id = ch.client_id  
LEFT JOIN journey_outcomes jo ON c.id = jo.client_id;

-- Success patterns view
CREATE VIEW success_patterns AS
SELECT 
  change_type,
  AVG(confidence_level) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(*) as total_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN conversion_status = 'paid' THEN 1 END) as paid_count,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN conversion_status = 'paid' THEN 1 END)::decimal / COUNT(*) * 100, 
    2
  ) as success_rate
FROM learning_correlations 
WHERE conversion_status IN ('paid', 'ghosted')
GROUP BY change_type;
```

### Component Architecture
- **LearningAnalyticsTab**: New dashboard tab for analytics
- **HypothesisOutcomeCorrelation**: Visual correlation component
- **PatternRecognitionCards**: Success/failure pattern display
- **SuccessFactorAnalysis**: Actionable insights component
- **LearningNotesSearch**: Searchable learning repository
- **TimelineCorrelation**: Journey duration analysis
- **ConfidenceTracker**: Hypothesis accuracy trends
- **LearningDataExport**: CSV/JSON export functionality

### Server Actions
- **`getLearningCorrelations()`**: Fetch hypothesis-outcome correlations
- **`getSuccessPatterns()`**: Identify conversion patterns
- **`getFailureAnalysis()`**: Analyze ghost/decline reasons
- **`searchLearningNotes()`**: Full-text search through learning data
- **`exportLearningData()`**: Generate export files
- **`getAnalyticsSummary()`**: Dashboard summary statistics

## Dependencies
- Story 2.1: Hypothesis capture system complete and tested
- Story 2.2: Outcome marking system complete and tested
- Existing dashboard tab infrastructure
- Learning data from content_hypotheses and journey_outcomes tables

## Dev Agent Notes

### Implementation Priority
1. **Database Analytics Views**: Create learning correlation and pattern views
2. **Dashboard Tab Integration**: Add Learning Analytics tab to existing dashboard
3. **Core Analytics Components**: Hypothesis correlation and pattern recognition
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Success factor analysis and timeline correlation
5. **Search and Export**: Learning notes search and data export features
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive analytics workflow testing

### Integration Points with Stories 2.1 & 2.2
- **Hypothesis Data**: Use content_hypotheses table from Story 2.1
- **Outcome Data**: Use journey_outcomes table from Story 2.2
- **Dashboard Structure**: Extend existing tabbed interface
- **Component Patterns**: Follow established Shadcn/ui component architecture

### Analytics Implementation Strategy
- **Performance Optimization**: Use database views for complex queries
- **Real-time Updates**: Analytics refresh when new outcomes are recorded
- **Data Visualization**: Use charts and graphs for pattern recognition
- **Mobile Responsive**: Analytics dashboard works on all screen sizes

### Code Quality Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode with analytics-specific interfaces
- Performance optimized queries for large learning datasets
- Error handling for analytics calculation failures
- Accessibility compliance for data visualization components
- Responsive design for analytics charts and tables

## QA Considerations

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Story 2.1 hypothesis capture continues working normally
- [ ] Story 2.2 outcome marking and filtering preserved
- [ ] Dashboard performance maintains acceptable speeds
- [ ] Client management workflow unaffected

### Analytics Testing Areas
- **Data Correlation**: Verify hypothesis-outcome links are accurate
- **Pattern Recognition**: Test success/failure pattern identification
- **Search Functionality**: Learning notes search accuracy and performance
- **Export Features**: Data export completeness and format validation
- **Mobile Analytics**: Touch-friendly analytics interface

### Performance Requirements
- Analytics tab load time ≤ 2 seconds
- Pattern recognition calculations ≤ 3 seconds
- Learning notes search response ≤ 1 second
- Export generation ≤ 5 seconds for 100+ records
- Mobile analytics interface smooth scrolling and interaction

### Edge Cases
- **No Learning Data**: Graceful handling when no hypotheses/outcomes exist
- **Large Datasets**: Performance with 1000+ client journeys
- **Incomplete Data**: Analytics when some hypotheses lack outcomes
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Multiple admins viewing analytics simultaneously

## Architecture Notes
Story 2.3 completes Epic 2's Learning Capture System by providing the analytical intelligence layer that transforms captured learning data into actionable revenue optimization insights. This creates a complete feedback loop: hypotheses → changes → outcomes → analysis → improved hypotheses.

## Success Metrics
- 100% correlation accuracy between hypotheses and outcomes
- ≤ 2 second load time for analytics dashboard
- Successful pattern identification with 90%+ accuracy
- Zero performance regression in existing functionality
- Mobile-responsive analytics interface
- Complete learning data export capabilities

## Revenue Intelligence Impact
Story 2.3 transforms Template Genius into a true Revenue Intelligence Engine by providing systematic analysis of what drives conversion. Admins can now identify successful patterns, understand failure causes, and continuously improve their client engagement strategies based on data-driven insights rather than intuition alone.

This completes the learning capture foundation necessary to achieve the target conversion rate improvement from 4.5% toward 30%+ through systematic pattern recognition and optimization.
