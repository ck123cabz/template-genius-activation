# Story 1.3: Admin Journey Page Navigation & Editing

## Status
COMPLETED - Approved for deployment

## Story
**As an admin**, I want to navigate between pages while editing a client's journey, **so that** I can ensure consistency and make informed edits across the complete client experience while capturing hypothesis and learnings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Admin can click on any journey page (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) from the dashboard to enter edit mode
- [x] Navigation between all 4 journey pages while maintaining edit context and unsaved changes
- [x] Page content editing with hypothesis capture before changes (learning system)
- [x] Visual consistency indicators showing differences/conflicts between pages
- [x] Context preservation during navigation (edit state, unsaved changes, client context)
- [x] Breadcrumb navigation showing current page and client context
- [x] Save/discard changes functionality with confirmation dialogs
- [~] Admin can preview how the page appears to the client during editing (Partial - framework ready)

## Build On Previous Work

**Story 1.1 Foundations:**
- Extended hypothesis tracking pattern to capture page edit rationale
- Used established G[token] client identification system throughout editing interface
- Built on server action patterns for all data operations
- Leveraged component enhancement approach over recreation

**Story 1.2 Journey Infrastructure:**
- Utilized existing `journey_pages` table structure without modification
- Extended journey progress system for editing context
- Built on `journey-actions.ts` server actions with new editing operations
- Used established page status management and template system
- Leveraged existing component architecture and styling patterns

## Dev Implementation Notes

**Server Actions Extensions:**
Extended `journey-actions.ts` with editing operations:
- `updateJourneyPageContent()` - Save content changes with hypothesis
- `updateJourneyPageHypothesis()` - Track editing rationale  
- `getClientJourneyPageByType()` - Fetch specific page data
- `recordJourneyPageEdit()` - Analytics for admin editing patterns

**Components Created:**

1. **JourneyPageEditor** - Main editing interface
   - Content editing with title and rich text fields
   - Hypothesis capture following Story 1.1 patterns
   - Real-time save functionality with error handling
   - Integration with consistency checker

2. **JourneyNavigation** - Page navigation system
   - Tab-based navigation between 4 page types
   - Unsaved changes protection with confirmation dialogs
   - Context preservation during navigation
   - Visual indicators for current page and edit state

3. **PageConsistencyChecker** - Quality validation
   - 6 automated consistency validations:
     - Title Length Consistency
     - Content Structure Analysis
     - Content Length Balance
     - Call-to-Action Presence
     - Content Readability Metrics
     - Journey Flow Context Validation
   - Real-time scoring with recommendations
   - Visual indicators and improvement suggestions
