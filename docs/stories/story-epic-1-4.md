## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights (Stories 1.1-1.3 Established Infrastructure)

**From Story 1.1 - Client Creation Foundation:**
- **Client Model Enhancement**: Complete G[4-digit] token system with `activationToken` field established
- **4-Page Journey Structure**: All 4 journey pages (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) automatically created for each client
- **Mock Data System**: Robust fallback system enables full development without database dependency
- **Server Actions Foundation**: `createClientWithFirstVersion` provides atomic client creation with journey setup

**From Story 1.2 - Multi-Page Infrastructure:**
- **JourneyNavigationTabs Component**: Professional tabbed navigation at `app/dashboard/components/JourneyNavigationTabs.tsx`
- **Enhanced ContentEditor**: Multi-page support with pageType prop at `app/dashboard/components/ContentEditor.tsx`
- **Journey Editor Route**: Complete editing experience at `app/dashboard/journey/[clientId]/page.tsx`
- **Server Actions Pattern**: `updateClientJourneyPageByType` and `getClientJourneyPageByType` with version tracking

**From Story 1.3 - Hypothesis Capture System:**
- **Enhanced ContentEditor**: Full hypothesis capture with dropdown options and validation at `app/dashboard/components/ContentEditor.tsx`
- **ContentHistoryPanel**: Version history with hypothesis tracking at `app/dashboard/components/ContentHistoryPanel.tsx`
- **Hypothesis-Required Workflow**: Content changes require learning hypothesis for systematic Revenue Intelligence
- **Server Action Enhancement**: `updateClientJourneyPageByType` captures hypothesis metadata (edit_hypothesis, hypothesis_type, content_update_reason)

### Architecture Context

**Data Models** [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#enhanced-client-model]
```typescript
// Client model with journey access
interface Client {
  id: UUID;
  company: string;
  contact: string;
  email: string;
  activationToken: string;        // G[4-digit] format - established in Story 1.1
  currentVersionId?: UUID;        // Links to active content version
  status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'paid' | 'failed';
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Content version model with hypothesis tracking
interface ContentVersion {
  id: UUID;
  clientId: UUID;
  pageType: 'activation' | 'agreement' | 'confirmation' | 'processing';
  content: JSONB;                 // Hypothesis-driven content from admin
  iterationNotes: string;         // Admin's rationale from Story 1.3
  hypothesis: string;             // Expected outcome from Story 1.3  
  outcome: 'success' | 'failure' | 'pending';
  isCurrent: boolean;
  versionNumber: number;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**API Specifications** [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#client-activation-support]
```typescript
// Enhanced client activation for all page types
export async function getClientJourneyContent(
  activationToken: string, 
  pageType: 'activation' | 'agreement' | 'confirmation' | 'processing'
): Promise<ClientJourneyData> {
  
  const client = await db.clients.findUnique({
    where: { activationToken },
    include: { currentVersion: true }
  });
  
  if (!client) {
    throw new Error('Invalid activation token');
  }
  
  // Get hypothesis-driven content for requested page
  const contentVersion = await db.contentVersions.findFirst({
    where: { 
      clientId: client.id, 
      pageType,
      isCurrent: true 
    }
  });
  
  return {
    client,
    content: contentVersion?.content || getDefaultContentForPage(pageType),
    pageType,
    versionId: contentVersion?.id
  };
}
```

**Component Specifications** [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#client-journey-experience]
**Client Journey Page Layout:**
- Location: `app/activate/[token]/[pageType]/page.tsx` (new dynamic route structure)
- Uses existing Shadcn UI components: Card, Button, Badge, Progress for consistent design
- Implements mobile-first responsive design with established Tailwind patterns
- Displays admin's hypothesis-driven content specific to each client

**Client Navigation Component:**
```typescript
interface ClientJourneyNavProps {
  client: Client;
  currentPage: 'activation' | 'agreement' | 'confirmation' | 'processing';
  onNavigate: (pageType: string) => void;
}

// Professional client-facing navigation
function ClientJourneyNav({ client, currentPage, onNavigate }) {
  const journeySteps = [
    { key: 'activation', label: 'Activation', status: 'completed' },
    { key: 'agreement', label: 'Agreement', status: currentPage === 'agreement' ? 'current' : 'pending' },
    { key: 'confirmation', label: 'Confirmation', status: 'pending' },
    { key: 'processing', label: 'Processing', status: 'pending' }
  ];
  
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-6">
        <div>
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">{client.company} Activation</h1>
          <Badge variant="secondary">{client.activationToken}</Badge>
        </div>
        <Progress value={getProgressValue(currentPage)} className="w-32" />
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex space-x-2">
        {journeySteps.map((step) => (
          <Button
            key={step.key}
            variant={step.status === 'current' ? 'default' : 'outline'}
            onClick={() => onNavigate(step.key)}
            disabled={step.status === 'pending'}
            className="flex-1"
          >
            {step.label}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
