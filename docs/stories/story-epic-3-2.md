## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Story 3.2 enhances the existing dashboard with comprehensive payment intelligence by extending the ClientList component and creating new payment-focused UI components. This builds directly on Story 3.1's Stripe integration and payment infrastructure.

### Previous Story Integration & Foundation
- **Story 3.1 Foundation (CRITICAL)**: Complete Stripe integration infrastructure established
  - Payment server actions in `/app/actions/payment-actions.ts`
  - PaymentButton, PaymentConfirmation, PaymentStatus components available
  - Enhanced webhook handlers with payment correlation tracking
  - Payment database schema operational with correlation system
  - ClientList already enhanced with basic payment status indicators (Task 6 from Story 3.1)

**Building Strategy:**
Story 3.2 extends the existing Story 3.1 payment foundation by creating comprehensive dashboard interfaces for payment management and revenue tracking.

### Core Technical Components

**Enhanced ClientList Component Architecture:**
```typescript
// Extended from Story 3.1 foundation
interface EnhancedClientListProps {
  features: {
    versionHistory: boolean;     // Existing from component architecture
    paymentTracking: boolean;    // Enhanced with comprehensive payment display
    learningCapture: boolean;    // Existing feature preserved
  };
}

// Payment status display integration
function PaymentStatusColumn({ client }: { client: Client }) {
  const paymentStatus = client.payments?.[0]?.status || 'pending';
  
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-start gap-1">
      <PaymentStatusBadge status={paymentStatus} />
      <PaymentProgressIndicator 
        journeyStep={client.journeyStep} 
        paymentCompleted={paymentStatus === 'succeeded'} 
      />
      {paymentStatus === 'succeeded' && (
        <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
          Paid {formatDistanceToNow(client.payments[0].createdAt)} ago
        </span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Payment Detail Interface:**
```typescript
interface PaymentDetailsProps {
  client: Client;
  payments: Payment[];
}

// Comprehensive payment information display
function PaymentDetails({ client, payments }: PaymentDetailsProps) {
  const latestPayment = payments[0];
  
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Payment Information</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent className="space-y-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          <div>
            <Label>Amount</Label>
            <p className="font-mono text-lg">$500.00</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <Label>Status</Label>
            <PaymentStatusBadge status={latestPayment?.status || 'pending'} />
          </div>
          <div>
            <Label>Payment Date</Label>
            <p>{latestPayment?.createdAt ? format(latestPayment.createdAt, 'PPP') : 'Not paid'}</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <Label>Transaction ID</Label>
            <p className="font-mono text-xs">{latestPayment?.stripePaymentIntentId || 'N/A'}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        {latestPayment?.status === 'failed' && (
          <PaymentRetryAlert 
            clientId={client.id} 
            onRetry={() => createPaymentSession(client.id)} 
          />
        )}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Required Server Actions Enhancement

**Payment Analytics Server Actions:**
```typescript
// Extended from Story 3.1 payment actions
export async function getPaymentAnalytics(timeframe: 'week' | 'month'): Promise<PaymentAnalytics> {
  const startDate = timeframe === 'week' 
    ? subDays(new Date(), 7)
    : subDays(new Date(), 30);
  
  const payments = await db.payments.findMany({
    where: {
      createdAt: {
        gte: startDate
      }
    },
    include: {
      client: true
    }
  });
  
  const successfulPayments = payments.filter(p => p.status === 'succeeded');
  const failedPayments = payments.filter(p => p.status === 'failed');
  const totalRevenue = successfulPayments.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.amount, 0) / 100; // Convert to dollars
  
  return {
    totalRevenue,
    successfulPayments: successfulPayments.length,
    failedPayments: failedPayments.length,
    successRate: Math.round((successfulPayments.length / payments.length) * 100),
    trendData: generateTrendData(payments, timeframe)
  };
}

// Client payment status aggregation
export async function getClientPaymentStatus(clientId: string): Promise<ClientPaymentStatus> {
  const client = await db.clients.findUnique({
    where: { id: clientId },
    include: {
      payments: {
        orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
        take: 1
      }
    }
  });
  
  const latestPayment = client?.payments[0];
  
  return {
    clientId,
    paymentStatus: latestPayment?.status || 'pending',
    paymentAmount: latestPayment?.amount || 50000,
    paymentDate: latestPayment?.createdAt,
    transactionId: latestPayment?.stripePaymentIntentId,
    canRetry: latestPayment?.status === 'failed'
  };
}
```

### Data Layer Integration
**Payment Dashboard Data:**
- Extends existing payment correlation system from Story 2.3
- Uses established payment database schema from Story 3.1
- Leverages existing Stripe webhook infrastructure
- Builds on existing client-journey correlation tracking

**Performance Considerations:**
- Dashboard loading time under 2 seconds (IV3 requirement)
- Efficient payment data aggregation with database indexing
- Client-side caching for revenue analytics data
- Optimized queries for payment status display

### UI Component Dependencies
**Existing Components to Reuse:**
- `Card`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Dialog`, `Table` from Shadcn UI library
- `ResponsiveContainer`, `AreaChart`, `CartesianGrid` from Recharts (already installed)
- Existing ClientList component foundation from Story 3.1
- PaymentStatusBadge and PaymentButton components from Story 3.1

**New Components to Create:**
- `PaymentDetails` - Comprehensive payment information display
- `PaymentAlert` - Failed payment notifications with retry
- `RevenueTracker` - Revenue analytics and visualization
- `PaymentProgressIndicator` - Journey step with payment status

### File Structure & Integration Points
**Enhanced Files:**
- `/app/dashboard/components/ClientList.tsx` - Add comprehensive payment columns and status
- `/app/actions/payment-actions.ts` - Add analytics and dashboard data server actions

**New Files:**

- Secure server actions with proper validation

**Error Handling Patterns:**
```typescript
// Payment dashboard error handling
interface PaymentDashboardError {
  type: 'loading_error' | 'data_error' | 'permission_error';
  message: string;
  retryable: boolean;
}

// Graceful error handling with user feedback
if (paymentData.error) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Payment Information</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <div className="text-center text-muted-foreground">
          <p>Unable to load payment data</p>
          {paymentData.error.retryable && (
            <Button onClick={refetchPaymentData} variant="outline" size="sm">
              Retry
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
