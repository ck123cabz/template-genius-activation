# Dev Agent Gate Checklist - Implementation & Quality Verification

## Instructions for Dev Agent

This checklist validates implementation quality before handoff to QA Agent. Complete each section and mark as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - DEV AGENT GATE VALIDATION

This checklist ensures Dev Agent deliverables meet BMAD quality standards for:

1. Code implementation and functionality
2. File creation and modification standards
3. Revenue Intelligence integration
4. Testing and quality verification
5. Documentation and handoff preparation

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Validate against existing story-dod-checklist.md patterns
2. Ensure Revenue Intelligence capture functionality works
3. Verify Playwright MCP testing integration
4. Test with docker-compose development environment
5. Prepare comprehensive QA handoff documentation

The goal is production-ready code that enables QA Agent validation.]]

- [ ] **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling with user-friendly messages

### Revenue Intelligence Integration
- [ ] **Hypothesis Capture:** Before/after learning workflow implemented
- [ ] **Journey Integration:** 4-page client journey flow enhanced correctly
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition:** Data structures support intelligence gathering
- [ ] **Outcome Tracking:** Payment correlation and learning persistence working
- [ ] **Admin Workflow:** Existing productivity patterns preserved and enhanced

## 2. CODE QUALITY & STANDARDS COMPLIANCE

[[LLM: Code must follow project conventions and be maintainable]]

### Code Standards
- [ ] **TypeScript Strict:** All code uses proper TypeScript with no `any` types
- [ ] **Linting Clean:** `pnpm lint` passes with no errors or warnings
- [ ] **Build Success:** `pnpm build` completes successfully
- [ ] **Component Patterns:** Uses established Shadcn/ui component patterns
- [ ] **Server Actions:** Follows Next.js 15 App Router server action conventions

### File Organization
- [ ] **File Structure:** New files follow project structure conventions
- [ ] **Component Location:** UI components in appropriate `/app/components/` subdirs
- [ ] **Naming Conventions:** Consistent file and component naming patterns
- [ ] **Import Patterns:** Proper relative imports and barrel exports used
- [ ] **Code Comments:** Complex logic documented with clear, technical comments

## 3. FILE CREATION & MODIFICATION VERIFICATION

[[LLM: All file operations must be correct and complete]]

### File Operations
- [ ] **Files Created:** All new files necessary for story implementation created
- [ ] **Files Modified:** Existing files enhanced without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] **File Permissions:** No file permission or access issues introduced
- [ ] **Dependencies Added:** New package dependencies justified and documented
- [ ] **Environment Variables:** New configs properly documented and secured

### Integration Points
- [ ] **Database Schema:** New tables/columns follow snake_case conventions
- [ ] **API Endpoints:** Server actions follow established patterns and security
- [ ] **Component Integration:** New components integrate with existing design system
- [ ] **Routing:** Any new routes follow App Router conventions
- [ ] **Middleware:** Authentication and security middleware properly configured

## 4. TESTING & QUALITY VERIFICATION

[[LLM: Implementation must be thoroughly tested and verified]]

### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests:** Critical business logic covered by unit tests
- [ ] **Integration Tests:** Component integration properly tested
- [ ] **Build Pipeline:** Tests pass in CI/CD environment
- [ ] **Coverage Metrics:** Test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] **Mock Integration:** Test data and mocks work correctly

### Manual Verification
- [ ] **Docker Environment:** `docker-compose up` runs cleanly on port 3000
- [ ] **Playwright MCP Testing:** Browser automation testing completed successfully
- [ ] **User Interface:** All UI components render and function correctly
- [ ] **Edge Cases:** Boundary conditions and error scenarios tested
- [ ] **Performance:** Page load times and interactions meet NFR requirements

## 5. REVENUE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE VALIDATION

[[LLM: Core business functionality must work end-to-end]]

### Learning Capture Workflow
- [ ] **Hypothesis Entry:** Admin can enter hypothesis before content changes
- [ ] **Content Versioning:** Content changes tracked with hypothesis context
- [ ] **Outcome Recording:** Payment outcomes correlate with content versions
- [ ] **Intelligence Persistence:** Learning data persists in Serena memory system
- [ ] **Pattern Recognition:** Data structure supports future analytics

### Client Journey Enhancement
- [ ] **4-Page Flow:** All journey pages (activation, agreement, confirmation, processing) work
- [ ] **Content Isolation:** Page-specific content editing and versioning functional
- [ ] **Navigation:** Client can move between journey pages seamlessly
- [ ] **Payment Integration:** Stripe integration captures conversion events
- [ ] **Admin Visibility:** Admin can view and analyze journey performance

## 6. TECHNICAL INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

[[LLM: System integration must be solid and maintainable]]

### External Service Integration
- [ ] **Supabase Connection:** Database operations work correctly with RLS
- [ ] **Stripe Integration:** Payment processing and webhook handling functional
- [ ] **Environment Management:** Local, test, and production configs separated
- [ ] **Error Logging:** Proper error tracking and debugging information
- [ ] **Security Compliance:** Input validation, authentication, and data protection

### Development Workflow
- [ ] **Git Integration:** Clean commit history with conventional commit messages
- [ ] **Branch Strategy:** Feature branch follows established naming conventions
- [ ] **Code Review:** Implementation ready for peer review process
- [ ] **Documentation:** Technical decisions documented in code and architecture
- [ ] **Deployment Ready:** Code can be deployed to staging/production environments

## 7. HANDOFF PREPARATION FOR QA AGENT

[[LLM: QA Agent needs complete context for effective validation]]

### QA Testing Setup
- [ ] **Test Environment:** Docker compose environment documented and ready
- [ ] **Test Data:** Mock data and test scenarios prepared for QA validation
- [ ] **Browser Testing:** Playwright MCP test cases documented and executable
- [ ] **API Testing:** Server action endpoints documented with expected inputs/outputs
- [ ] **User Workflows:** Complete user journey test scenarios documented

### Implementation Documentation
- [ ] **Changes Summary:** Clear description of what was implemented
- [ ] **Technical Decisions:** Key implementation choices documented with rationale
- [ ] **Known Issues:** Any limitations or technical debt clearly identified
- [ ] **Testing Notes:** Specific areas requiring QA attention highlighted
- [ ] **Rollback Plan:** How to revert changes if critical issues found

## FINAL DEV AGENT VALIDATION

[[LLM: DEV GATE SUMMARY

After completing the checklist:

1. Summarize implementation completeness and quality
2. List any known issues or limitations
3. Confirm Revenue Intelligence integration works end-to-end
4. Note any technical debt or follow-up work needed
